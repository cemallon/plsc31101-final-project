		USA: Exoneration of Scott Warren is a triumph for humanity
	","
		In response to the humanitarian volunteer Dr Scott Warren being found not guilty of the charges against him in a court in Arizona today, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said:
“Sense has prevailed today with the jury exonerating Dr. Scott Warren for a simple reason: humanitarian aid is never a crime. The Trump administration is wrong to try to prosecute people who are only trying to save lives. By threatening Dr. Warren with a decade in prison, the US government sought to criminalize compassion and weaponize the deadly desert against people who make the perilous journey to the United States in search of safety.”

Background information: 
This was the second trial Dr Warren has faced on charges of “harbouring” two migrants, for providing them with humanitarian assistance in the town of Ajo, Arizona, where he lives. The first trial resulted in a mistrial on 2 July, when eight of 12 jurors sought to acquit him on all charges but could not reach a unanimous decision.
In July, Amnesty International issued a report documenting the Trump administration’s misuse of the criminal justice system to threaten, intimidate, and punish those defending the human rights of migrants and asylum seekers on the US–Mexico border.

		Philippines: Authorities must not deport Iranian asylum seeker trapped in Manila airport
	","
		A 31-year-old Iranian asylum seeker, Bahareh Zarebahari, may be at risk of being deported to Iran where she could face detention and torture, said Amnesty International today. A decision on her case is reported to be imminent. She is entering her fourth week in detention, trapped in the transit area of Manila’s main airport.
“Bahareh Zarebahari has been a vocal critic of the Iranian authorities and a public opponent of forced veiling. If the Philippines authorities send her to Iran she risks arrest, torture and other ill-treatment, and unfair trial and imprisonment,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia.
“The Philippines authorities have an obligation under international law to refrain from sending anyone to a country where they could be at risk of serious human rights violations.”

			Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International
		
Zarebahari, who has lived in the Philippines for the past five years and represented Iran at the 2018 Miss Intercontinental beauty pageant in Manila, was detained upon arrival in Manila from Dubai on 17 October 2019. Philippine authorities acted on an Interpol Red Notice placed on her by Iranian authorities. She has still not been told what charges she faces in Iran.
She has since been held in a room in Terminal 3 of Manila’s Ninoy Aquino international airport. According to reports, the Red Notice relates to an offence the Iranian authorities allege she committed in Iran in 2018 but Zarebahari says she has not travelled to Iran since 2014. In her social media posts on Facebook and Instagram, she has claimed that the Iranian authorities want to punish her for her opposition to the Islamic Republic.
A dentistry student in the Philippines, Zarebahari has been vocal about her support for Iran’s former crown prince, Reza Pahlavi. During the 2018 beauty contest in Manila, she waved a poster of Reza Pahlavi and draped herself in the former national flag of Iran, which bears the lion and sun emblem that has become associated with the deposed royal family.
In a media interview on 21 October, Zarehbahari said that her problems in the Philippines began after she participated in the beauty pageant. She said she began receiving threatening messages from an official in the Iranian embassy in the Philippines who told her she had to visit the embassy questioning.
“It’s appalling that she has been detained for so long in airport transit, in such dismal conditions,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “The Philippines authorities have a clear international legal obligation to keep her safe and not return her to Iran, where she could face human rights violations.”
In a series of messages on her social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram, Zarebahari says that airport authorities have detained her like a prisoner and denied her any visitors besides limited access to her Philippines lawyers. She has been shouted at while trying to sleep, is exposed to bright lights 24 hours a day, and has no access to hot water. She says her physical and mental health have deteriorated by her three-week detention. She has not been sleeping and suffers from constant headaches.
Zarebahari says that three weeks ago, security guards handcuffed her, pulled her by her hair, arms and legs and tried to force her on a plane to Iran. In recent days, despite her pending asylum case, airport authorities tried to coerce her to sign papers agreeing to her deportation to Iran. In recent Facebook posts, she says that she has no update from the Philippines authorities about her case, though, according to some reports, a decision on her case is imminent.
Previously, Markk Perete, Undersecretary at the Philippine Department of Justice, said that “the only reason she was held at the airport […] is only because of that Red Notice issued against her.”
On 6 November, Philippines Senator and Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience Leila de Lima raised concerns about Bahareh Zarebahari's case and urged the Philippines government to consider her asylum application in compliance with international human rights law.
Under international law, all states are entitled to regulate access and residence of foreigners on their territory and return people who are irregularly present on their territory to their country of origin. However, like any other state, the Philippines is bound by the principle of non-refoulement, which is the cornerstone of refugee law, enshrined in customary international law. Under this principle, governments are prohibited from sending anyone to a country where they would be at risk of serious human rights violations.

		USA: Trump administration's asylum ban could be a death sentence for people seeking safety
	","
		Today, Amnesty International condemned the Supreme Court’s decision allowing the Trump administration’s asylum ban to temporarily proceed. Charanya Krishnaswami, the Advocacy Director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA, stated:
“The asylum ban the Supreme Court has upheld could be a death sentence for people in search of safety and protection. The asylum ban is grounded in an ideology of hatred and xenophobia, and it cannot stand. 
“Every person has the right to seek safety: this is a moment that will prove itself infamous, when the country turned its back on those it used to welcome and chose to ignore people’s humanity.”
Next week, Amnesty International will travel to South Texas to seek access to the secretive port courts that have been built for assembly-line proceedings for asylum-seekers subject to the Trump administration’s Remain in Mexico policy, under which the U.S. government forces people to stay in Mexico while they ask for asylum in the United States. 

	
	
		Every person has the right to seek safety: this is a moment that will prove itself infamous, when the country turned its back on those it used to welcome and chose to ignore people’s humanity
	

		
			Charanya Krishnaswami, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA
		
Background and context: 
Amnesty International has documented the dangers that people seeking asylum face, not just in their countries of origin, but also on their journeys to safety. We have previously found that LGBTI-identifying asylum-seekers from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras face tremendous risks of sexual assault, violence, and harm on their journey north. The ban could mean that LGBTI-identifying people would be forced to seek protection in places where they are at grave risk of harm.
Amnesty International has also found that Mexico’s asylum system is ill-equipped to respond to the number of people who could be forced to seek protection there. Amnesty International’s investigation found that far from providing asylum-seekers safety, the Mexican government instead routinely detains them and deports them into harm’s way. Recent actions by the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, including the deployment of National Guard troops throughout the country to crack down on asylum-seekers, have made the situation even more dangerous for asylum-seekers. According to official numbers,  Mexico’s deportation numbers increased from from 53,747 January to June 2018 to 71,376 in the same period in 2019. 
Under the “Remain in Mexico” program, Amnesty International has found that asylum-seekers who are forced to wait in Mexico are subject to grave harm, including kidnapping, assault, and extortion by the very authorities who are supposed to protect them.

		Tanzania: Confidential document shows forced repatriation of Burundi refugees imminent
	","
		A leaked, confidential document seen and reviewed by Amnesty International confirms fears that the repatriation of Burundian refugees from Tanzania will not be wholly voluntary and could start as soon as next week.

	
	
		It is extremely shocking that the Government of Tanzania is willing to send  people against their will to a place the UN has deemed requires close monitoring as crimes against humanity and serious human rights violations continue unchecked.
	

		
			Seif Magango, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes
		
The bilateral agreement signed by Tanzania’s Minister for Home Affairs Kangi Lugola and Burundi’s Minister of Interior Pascal Barandagiye on 24 August states that the new planned returns process would begin in the “second week of September and be completed by 31 December 2019” and that “returns would continue with or without refugees’ consent”.
“It is extremely shocking that the Government of Tanzania is willing to send  people against their will to a place the UN has deemed requires close monitoring as crimes against humanity and serious human rights violations continue unchecked,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“This accelerated timeline for returns is extremely alarming. That these two governments are in such a hurry to return people who fled Burundi because they felt their lives were at risk clearly demonstrates that their safety is not considered a priority.

			Seif Magango, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes
		
 “With serious human rights violations and acts of repression continuing, it is essential that asylum space remains open to Burundians who are still leaving the country, as well as those who fled previously,” Seif Magango said.
Nearly 75,000 people have already returned to Burundi from Tanzania since September 2017 under a voluntary repatriation programme facilitated by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
But this new agreement shows that the two countries have thrown caution to the wind and will proceed with their plans even against the advice of UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

	
	
		The governments of Tanzania and Burundi must immediately abandon their new plans to forcibly repatriate Burundi refugees.
	

		
			Seif Magango, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes
		
The agreement reads; “whether our partner UNHCR will show interest to play their role or wants to delay us, we, the two countries, will proceed with this exercise to ensure that these Burundians go to their home.”
Amnesty International is calling for the immediate shelving of this agreement.
“The governments of Tanzania and Burundi must immediately abandon their new plans to forcibly repatriate Burundi refugees,” said Seif Magango.
“All three parties must ensure that any returns undertaken are genuinely voluntary and conducted in safety and with dignity in line with international principles and standards.”

The Tanzanian authorities must further publicly reassure Burundian refugees and asylum-seekers that they will continue receiving protection in Tanzania, without pressure to return.
Background
In January 2017, the Tanzanian authorities ended prima facie recognition of refugees from Burundi, meaning that all asylum seekers coming from Burundi were from then on individually assessed.
By July 2018, the Government of Tanzania had closed all reception centres at border entry points from Burundi – both restricting access to the country and the possibility of claiming asylum.
The government has further temporarily closed the refugees’ common markets and some refugee-run businesses in the camps putting great pressure on the Burundian refugee community to leave the country.

		Switzerland: Judgment day for pensioner convicted for showing compassion to frost-bitten asylum-seeker
	","
		Ahead of tomorrow’s appeal against the conviction of Anni Lanz, a 73-year-old woman convicted and fined with 800 Swiss francs ($820 US) for giving a rough-sleeping frost-bitten Afghan asylum seeker a lift over the Italian border into Switzerland, Amnesty International’s Senior Campaigner on Migration, Maria Serrano, said:
“Anni Lanz has done nothing wrong and committed no crime. By driving across the border to help a young and traumatized man who had been forced to sleep rough in sub-zero temperatures, she showed compassion, not criminality.

	
	
		Efforts by individuals and NGOs to help people seeking safety should be lauded and defended, not criminalised
	

		
			Maria Serrano, Amnesty International
		
“The conviction against Anni should be overturned and legislation in Switzerland amended so it no longer punishes good Samaritans for acts of solidarity.
“Dragging her before the court on absurd charges makes a mockery of justice. Efforts by individuals and NGOs to help people seeking safety should be lauded and defended, not criminalised.”
Background 
Anni Lanz was charged with facilitating irregular entry into Switzerland, after she gave a lift to an Afghan asylum seeker she found sleeping outside a train station in freezing conditions in Italy, near the Swiss border. She had originally met the man in a removal centre in Basel.
He was suffering from serious psychological problems following the reported death of his wife and child and was desperate to stay with his sister in Switzerland. Despite medical reports provided to Swiss authorities recommending that he be allowed to stay with his sister, Swiss authorities had returned him to Italy.
After hearing that he did not have a place in the reception centre in Italy and was sleeping in the streets in temperatures of minus 10 degrees, Anni went to pick him up. Article 116 of the Federal Aliens Law in Switzerland criminalizes the facilitation of irregular entry, stay and circulation.
Although the law foresees different penalties for those who facilitate for profit and those who don’t, Amnesty considers that the criminal justice should never be used to punish acts of solidarity. Anni Lanz has worked on refugee rights since 1985 and is well-known in Switzerland.

		Italy/Malta/Spain: 121 people including babies and children stranded at sea in searing heat must be allowed to dock
	","
		More than 30 children, including two babies, and nearly 90 men and women stranded at sea in searing temperatures, must be immediately allowed to dock, said Amnesty International, as the stand-off between the Italian, Maltese and Spanish authorities and a NGO rescue ship enters its second week.
Despite mounting concerns for their well-being, Italian and Maltese authorities are refusing a port where they could safely be disembarked. Spanish authorities have yet to formally request help from European institutions to mediate a solution.

	
	
		After a week stranded at sea in blistering heat, these women, men and children should be immediately disembarked either in Malta or Italy
	

		
			Maria Serrano, Amnesty International
		
“After a week stranded at sea in blistering heat, these women, men and children who have risked their lives to escape human rights abuses in Libya should be immediately disembarked either in Malta or Italy,” said Maria Serrano, Amnesty International’s Senior Researcher on Migration.
“Despite mounting concerns for the well-being of those on board, politicians are shamelessly breaching their responsibilities under international law by refusing to grant a safe port to people who could face torture if returned to Libya and who are exhausted and in need of protection and care.”
Seven days after they were rescued from the water by the Proactiva Open Arms NGO ship, 121 people - including 30 children and two babies - remain on board in sweltering heat and overcrowded conditions. The ship, sailing under the Spanish flag, remains about 30 nautical miles from Italy, between Malta and Lampedusa.
Those on board were saved in two rescues on 1 and 2 August in international waters, the first at 78 nautical miles from Libya and the second one close to the Maltese search and rescue zone. Many claim to have suffered extreme forms of abuse whilst in detention in Libya and some reportedly have third degree burns and gunshot wounds. At least one man claims to have sustained his injuries during last month’s attack on Tajoura detention centre in Tripoli.

	
	
		It is unconscionable that just off the beaches on which holiday-makers bask, babies are stranded at sea
	

		
			Maria Serrano, Amnesty International
		
This stand-off comes a day after the Italian parliament signed off on Minister of Interior Salvini’s second “security decree”. The new law, dubbed “the Decreto Sicurezza bis”, means that private rescue boats entering Italian territorial waters without permission could face fines of up to 1 million Euros and be impounded.
This is just the latest in a series of instances of ships in the Central Mediterranean rescuing people at sea only to be blocked from docking in the nearest safe port. UNHCR and UN Special rapporteurs have already criticized the new measures which could further discourage shipmasters from rescuing people while states have mostly withdrawn from rescue efforts in the central Mediterranean. Meanwhile, another boat from the NGO Proactiva, the Astral, will depart from Spain on Saturday to provide assistance – including food, water and medical supplies - to the Open Arms.
“It is unconscionable that just off the beaches on which holiday-makers bask, babies are stranded at sea. European states, starting with Italy and Malta, have brazenly undermined the search and rescue system and used people as pawns to negotiate abusive migration policies, with callous disregard for peoples’ safety,” said Maria Serrano.

	
	
		It is time that European governments stop playing with people’s lives and deploy adequate resources for search and rescue where they are needed
	

		
			Maria Serrano, Amnesty International
		
“It is time that European governments stop playing with people’s lives and deploy adequate resources for search and rescue where they are needed. They must urgently agree on a swift and predictable disembarkation mechanism in line with international law and on a fair system to distribute asylum-seekers among EU countries.”
Background:
Prompt disembarkation is discouraged by the unfairness of the European asylum rules (the so-called Dublin system). These determine the country responsible for examining an asylum application.
Usually the country through which the asylum-seeker first entered the EU is responsible for examining their asylum claim. This forces a few countries to process the majority of the applications.

		Latest Mediterranean drowning demands ‘courageous’ response from EU leaders 
	","
		Reacting to yesterday’s news that almost 150 people have drowned in the Mediterranean and around the same number have been returned to Libya by the Libyan Coastguard, where they risk indefinite detention, Massimo Moratti, Research Director for Europe at Amnesty International, said:
“If reports that 150 people have drowned are confirmed this represents the highest death toll from a shipwreck in the Mediterranean this year.
“This high number represents a new low for European leaders. They have done everything they can to pull up the drawbridge to Europe; withdrawing Search and Rescue Operations; criminalising NGO rescue boats; cooperating with the Libyan coastguard, and yet people are still risking their lives to come to Europe.
“Despite the increasingly risky journey and the unspeakable obstacles, people attempting the crossing to Europe demonstrate enormous hope in a better future and enormous courage to make it happen. We need to see European leaders show some courage too and shift their approach to a humane one which saves lives and doesn’t condemn those who survive to detention in Libya.”

		USA: Trump’s racist slurs translates into degrading, dehumanizing policies
	","
		Responding to President Trump’s toxic tweets accusing four Democrat Congresswomen of hating the United States and suggesting they go back to the “totally broken and crime infested places from which they came”, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo, said:

	
	
		As President of the United States, Trump has demonized minority groups, whipped up hatred, fear and sowed division.

“As President of the United States, Trump has demonized minority groups, whipped up hatred, fear and sowed division. Trump’s ugly targeting of these Congresswomen exposes the racism and xenophobia at the heart of his despicable policies – from imposing a travel ban on people travelling from Muslim majority countries to separating children from their parents at the Mexican border to denying the rights of people seeking asylum. His words prove that xenophobia, rather than the safety of the people of the United States, motivates these policies.
“President Trump must stop normalizing racism, sexism, transphobia, cruelty and hate. He must start seeing all people, not just a favoured few, as humans; not scapegoats or targets for ridicule. He must honour the US’ commitments to the world’s most vulnerable, including people fleeing horrific violence and persecution, and protect the human rights of all.”

In a series of tweets on 14 July, President Trump said of the four Congresswomen: “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how ... it is done.”
Trump did not identify the lawmakers by name in his 14 July tweets, but it was widely understood that he was referring to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.

		Turkey: Refugee stranded in airport transit zone at risk of imminent deportation
	","
		A Palestinian refugee from Syria who has been stranded in the transit zone of Istanbul Airport for more than six weeks is at risk of imminent deportation and must be granted access to the Turkish territory, said Amnesty International.

	
	
		As thousands of passengers stream through Istanbul’s new airport terminal, all Mohamed Ajlani Younes can do is watch and wait
	

		
			Adriana Tidona, Amnesty International
		
Mohamed Ajlani Younes has been living in the airport with no access to adequate food, natural light or fresh air since 26 May.
“As thousands of passengers stream through Istanbul’s new airport terminal, all Mohamed Ajlani Younes can do is watch and wait. He is at risk of imminent deportation to Lebanon which would put him in danger of being sent to Syria, where he would be at risk of serious human rights violations,"" said Adriana Tidona, Migration Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Mohamed has nowhere to sleep or bathe and has been surviving on cheese sandwiches, water and fruit juice, and the situation is adversely affecting his health. Turkish authorities should immediately allow him to enter Turkey and access the support to which he is entitled as an asylum seeker.”

	
	
		Mohamed is at risk of imminent deportation to Lebanon which would put him in danger of being sent to Syria, where he would be at risk of serious human rights violations
	

		
			Adriana Tidona, Amnesty International
		
While Mohamed’s asylum application in Turkey has not been decided and there is no formal deportation decision against him, there have been two attempts to deport him to Lebanon. From there he could be deported to Syria.
BACKGROUND
Mohamed Ajlani Younes fled Syria in 2012 and moved to Lebanon, where he lived in the Shatila refugee camp with his wife and two children, who continue to reside in the camp. After leaving Lebanon, on 26 May 2019 he was stopped in Istanbul airport, allegedly for travelling with a fake passport, and denied entry into Turkey.
On 28 May he made an application for asylum in Turkey expressing his fears about being returned to Lebanon. Asylum seekers should not be penalised for illegal entry in a country where they seek protection, as long as they present themselves without delay to the authorities showing good cause for it.
Amnesty recently reported on the deteriorating conditions and mounting hostility in Lebanon against refugees from Syria and believes that the coercive environment created by the Lebanese authorities is forcing them to return to Syria, in breach of Lebanon’s obligations under the non-refoulement principle, which forbids the transfer of individuals to a country where they would face serious human rights violations.

		USA: Authorities are misusing justice system to harass migrant human rights defenders
	","
		Since 2018, the US government has conducted an unlawful and discriminatory campaign of intimidation, threats, harassment, and criminal investigations against people who defend the human rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers on the US–Mexico border, Amnesty International said in a new report released today.
‘Saving lives is not a crime’: Politically motivated legal harassment of migrant human rights defenders by the USA reveals how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have increasingly misused the criminal justice system to deter activists, lawyers, journalists, and humanitarian volunteers from challenging – or simply documenting – the systematic human rights violations that US authorities have committed against migrants and asylum seekers.
“The Trump administration’s targeting of human rights defenders through discriminatory misuse of the criminal justice system sets it on a slippery slope toward authoritarianism. The US government is disgracing itself by threatening and even prosecuting its own citizens for their vital work to save the lives of people in a desperate situation at the border,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International..

	
	
		In recent days, President Trump has threatened to arrest and deport millions of people residing irregularly in the USA, including those whose family members are US citizens. Who will authorities target next with spurious charges of smuggling, simply for seeking to support communities who are under attack?
	

		
			Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
		
 
The US government has inappropriately investigated human rights defenders for alleged crimes including human smuggling, based on their humanitarian and human rights-related activities, and their expression of political or other opinions. While the most sweeping investigations targeted human rights defenders supporting a large caravan of migrants and asylum seekers in November 2018, authorities have continued to target those and other defenders since then, including simply for helping asylum seekers to know their rights and request protection at an official port of entry.
US authorities have subjected human rights defenders to warrantless surveillance, interrogations, invasive searches, travel restrictions, and, in isolated cases, a false arrest and unlawful detention. In so doing, they have violated the Constitution, US and international law, and DHS policies – all of which prohibit discriminatory restrictions of freedom of speech and expression. In some cases, US and Mexican authorities have reportedly collaborated in the unlawful restrictions against human rights defenders on their shared border.
Amnesty International interviewed 23 human rights defenders, who detailed the restrictions they have faced because of their professional activities. Ten of them – five activists, three lawyers, a journalist and a clergy member – were included on a DHS surveillance watch list, as part of a dubious criminal investigation into human smuggling. They provided similar accounts of how US authorities have used the border region as a criminal dragnet, exploiting their authority to conduct warrantless searches, interrogate travellers about their finances and professional networks, and search their electronic devices – apparently seeking to build criminal cases against them.
“In recent days, President Trump has threatened to arrest and deport millions of people residing irregularly in the USA, including those whose family members are US citizens. Who will authorities target next with spurious charges of smuggling, simply for seeking to support communities who are under attack?” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“The Trump administration must immediately end its politically motivated misuse of the criminal justice system and its abuse of powers to search, detain and interrogate human rights defenders at the border. Instead of targeting lawyers, journalists, and activists for trying to stop human rights violations, the government should be listening to them.”

So far this year, US authorities have criminally prosecuted nine humanitarian volunteers from the organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes, for their provision of humanitarian aid to migrants and asylum seekers on the border of Arizona with Mexico, where thousands of people have died over the last two decades. Among the most serious charges, Dr. Scott Warren was prosecuted for alleged crimes of harboring and conspiracy to transport two migrants, simply for providing them with water, food, and medical assistance in the desert town of Ajo, where he lives. The case ended in a mistrial on 11 June, yet federal prosecutors have still not yet dropped the charges against Dr. Warren.
“Humanitarian volunteers have been saving the lives of migrants and asylum seekers for years, in hostile desert terrain that authorities have weaponized against migrants with deadly effects. The US government must immediately drop all charges against Dr. Warren and adopt and implement exemptions from criminal prosecution in all situations involving the provision of humanitarian aid,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

		Amnesty International has received information about the events that took place on 23 June in the northern state of Sonora, where members of the National Guard attempted to raid, without a warrant or legal cause, the Centro de Atención al Migrante Exodus (CAME) shelter and harass the human rights defenders working there. In response, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said:
“As we have so often repeated, the National Guard lacks the necessary training to guarantee the legal rights of migrants and people seeking asylum.

		Eritrea: Government officials and supporters target critics abroad as repression stretches beyond borders
	","
		As Eritrea sits in the foremost human rights body, the UN Human Rights Council, government officials and supporters abroad are harassing and intimidating exiled human rights defenders (HRDs) and activists simply for criticizing the oppressive regime, shows a new Amnesty International briefing out today.
The briefing, Repression without borders found that HRDs are particularly at risk in Kenya, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where Amnesty International documented attacks by Eritrean government officials and supporters on government critics, including an Eritrean Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Father Mussie Zerai, and former BBC Africa Editor Martin Plaut. 

	
	
		For many HRDs, fleeing Eritrea has not provided them with much respite from the repression many people die trying to escape.
	

		
			Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes
		
“For many HRDs, fleeing Eritrea has not provided them with much respite from the repression many people die trying to escape. They have to constantly look over their shoulders and watch every word they say, afraid of the long arm of the Eritrean government which evidently extends across borders,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
Supporters of Eritrea’s ruling party and government officials use all manner of tactics to harass and intimidate critics of President Isaias Afwerki’s government and its human rights violations. These tactics include death threats, physical assault and spreading of lies.

 The briefing, which examines the period from 2011 to May 2019, also highlights the authorities’ use of the militant youth wing of the ruling party to “fight the country’s enemies” in Europe and the USA.
In April this year, Eritrea’s Minister of Information Yemane Gebre Meskel, the ambassador to Japan, Estifanos Afeworki, and his counterpart in Kenya, Beyene Russom, took to Twitter and harassed, intimidated and disparaged organizers and participants of a conference in London on ‘Building Democracy in Eritrea’. In his tweet, Minister Gebre Meskel dismissed the organizers as “Eritrean quislings”.

 “Such Twitter tirades by government officials clearly show the authorities’ intolerance of dissent and criticism by anyone anywhere, even at a time when the country is a member of the UN Human Rights Council,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
Militant party supporters
Supporters of Eritrea’s ruling People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), and notably its youth wing, the Young People’s Front for Democracy and Justice (YPFDJ), are at the forefront of these attacks on Eritrean human rights defenders and activists in Europe.
In deciding a defamation case in Amsterdam, a Dutch court in Feb 2016 ruled as follows:
“…YPFDJ receives instructions from the PFDJ, that the YPFDJ has (support of) the regime of Afwerki as its goal and that members of the YPFDJ are acting as informants for (the embassies of) the regime in Eritrea. The YPFDJ can thus, at this point, be called the extended arm of a dictatorial regime.”
Winta Yemane, born in Italy and eager to connect with her Eritrean roots, joined the youth wing while in high school, and participated in their 2011 annual conference held in Oslo, Norway. When she articulated her wishes for the country’s constitution, human rights and an independent judiciary, she quickly found herself on the wrong side of senior government officials in attendance.

	
	
		The officials said that I am a victim of misinformation by the western propaganda and enemies of Eritrea.

“The officials said that I am a victim of misinformation by the western propaganda and enemies of Eritrea. They also said that my comments do not have weight because I am a minor. Three of the organizers even threatened to throw me out of the conference,” Winta told Amnesty International.
Upon returning home to Milan, she was stalked for a couple of weeks, received threatening phone calls from unknown numbers and was the victim of a smear campaign on social media.
Several other Eritreans living in the diaspora including Daniel Mekonnen, Director of the association of Eritrean lawyers in exile and Father Mussie Zerai, a Catholic priest nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 for his work with migrants, also said they found themselves on the wrong side of the ruling party’s supporters and endured similar harassment and attacks. 

	
	
		Eritrea’s Ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki praised the journalist’s attack on Twitter.
	





This treatment is, however, not reserved for Eritreans. Former BBC Africa Editor Martin Plaut on 30 November 2018 was lured into a meeting with an Eritrean “source” at the British Library in London and doused with a bucket of liquid for his journalistic work on human rights in the country, and called a “traitor”. Eritrea’s Ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki praised the journalist’s attack on Twitter.
Nairobi: “Subversive, Terrorists”
In Nairobi in 2013, following an initiative to set up and register a diaspora civic organisation - the Eritrean Diaspora for East Africa (EDEA), the Eritrean Embassy revoked the Eritrean passport of Chairman and Co-founder Hussein Osman Said and had him arrested in South Sudan by alleging that he was a terrorist working to sabotage the Eritrean government.
EDEA officials told Amnesty International when they tried to launch the organisation in February 2015, two people who identified themselves as members of Kenya’s National Intelligence Service ordered them not to proceed with the event, alleging that they had intelligence that EDEA had been established to overthrow the Eritrean government.

	
	
		Eritrea’s use of its embassies abroad to harass and repress its critics must not be allowed to continue.

Such baseless claims against activities planned by Eritreans in Kenya continued in 2017, when the Eritrean Embassy wrote to the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON) claiming some 13 guests invited for an art exhibition were “subversive”. UNON subsequently barred the 13 from entering the UN complex at Gigiri, where the exhibition was taking place. 
“Eritrea’s use of its embassies abroad to harass and repress its critics must not be allowed to continue,” said Joan Nyanyuki.

		Norway: Stop the deportation of three young unaccompanied siblings to Afghanistan
	","
		 
The Norwegian government must immediately halt the deportation of a 16-year-old boy and his two siblings back to Afghanistan where they will be at grave risk of serious human rights violations, Amnesty International said today.

	
	
		Uprooting these three young siblings from the communities and deporting them alone to a warzone is an unconscionable abuse of power
	

		
			Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International
		
Eshan Abbasi (16) and his sister Taibeh (20) and brother Yasin (22), were deported from Norway to Istanbul on Saturday together with their mother. Due to her health condition, their mother is expected to be returned to Norway, but the children are in danger of being flown to Kabul imminently.
“Uprooting these three young siblings from the communities where they have lived for more than seven years and deporting them alone to a warzone is an unconscionable abuse of power,” said Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International’s Deputy Europe Director.
“Afghanistan is not a safe country for returns, and if this heartless and unnecessary deportation is completed it will split the family, endanger these three young people’s live and rob them of their futures.”
Taibeh Abbasi was born in Iran to Afghan parents and fled to Norway with her mother and brothers in 2012. She is a brave human rights defender, speaking out for her family, who have been fully supported by their local community in Trondheim.

	
	
		If this heartless and unnecessary deportation is completed it will split the family, endanger three young people's lives and rob them of their futures
	

		
			Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International
		
The Norwegian government has justified the family’s deportation by claiming that Afghanistan is safe for returns. This claim is contradicted by the record-high levels of violence documented across Afghanistan. Earlier this month, the Institute for Peace and Economics described Afghanistan as the ‘least peaceful’ country in the world.
The whereabouts of the family in Istanbul are unknown but it is believed that they have had no access to information or contact with the outside world since they were put on a plane early on Saturday.

	
	
		This deportation is emblematic of the cruel and dehumanising policies of many European governments
	

		
			Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International
		
“This deportation is emblematic of the cruel and dehumanising policies of many European governments, who are turning a blind eye to the reality of life in Afghanistan in order to increase the number of returns,” said Massimo Moratti.
“Norway must immediately reverse this callous decision and allow the siblings to return to their home and their friends in Norway and it must stop the dangerous and illegal return of all asylum seekers to Afghanistan. Norwegian and Turkish authorities must ensure the family can communicate with the outside world and receive information, legal counselling and support from organizations.”

Background 
There are reportedly 10 Norwegian immigration police in Istanbul escorting the siblings to Kabul.
Since 2017, more than 280,000 people have signed an Amnesty International petition calling on Norway’s government not to deport Taibeh and her family.
Norway appears to deport more Afghans than almost any other European country – not just in proportion to its population, but in sheer total numbers. According to the Afghan authorities, 32% (97 out of 304 people) of forcible returns from Europe in the first four months of 2017 came from Norway.
In 2018, the United Nations documented the highest ever recorded civilian deaths in Afghanistan, including the highest ever recorded number of children killed in the conflict. There were nearly 11,000 casualties which included 3,804 deaths and 7,189 injuries.

		France: Conviction against human rights defender for a tweet must be overturned
	","
		Ahead of the appeal against the conviction of Loan Torondel, a human rights defender found guilty of defamation after tweeting a photograph of policemen standing over one of the many people evicted from informal camps in Calais last year, Katia Roux, Advocacy Officer on Human Rights Defenders at Amnesty International France, said:
“Loan Torondel has done nothing wrong and his defamation conviction must be overturned. His prosecution exposes the way in which human rights defenders dedicated to providing aid to people seeking safety in Europe are harassed and targeted through the criminal justice system simply for acting with humanity and compassion.

	
	
		“If the conviction is allowed to stand, it will set a dangerous precedent for anybody attempting to document police abuse in France
	

		
			Katia Roux, Amnesty International France
		
“If the conviction is allowed to stand, it will set a dangerous precedent for anybody attempting to document police abuse in France. It will also have a chilling effect on the work of people defending the rights of migrants and refugees and leave them in an even more precarious situation.
“Criminal defamation laws that inhibit legitimate criticism of public officials are contrary to the right to freedom of expression and must be repealed. The authorities must stop harassing human rights defenders through the courts.”
 
Background
The trial will take place on 27 May, at 2pm in the Appeal’s Court of Douai.
Loan Torondel, was convicted for defamation after posting a photo of two police officers on Twitter. The tweet posted in January 2018 contained a photograph taken as he monitored the humanitarian situation of migrants and refugees as part of the Calais-based group L’Auberge des Migrants. The picture shows French police officers standing over a man who appears to be a migrant sitting on his sleeping bag. The caption suggests the officers are about to take away the man’s blanket despite the cold temperatures.
Amnesty International opposes laws criminalizing defamation, whether of public figures or private individuals, where cases should be treated as a matter for civil litigation.
Amnesty International is aware of numerous reports which suggest abusive behaviour by police forces against refugees and migrants and those who defend their rights in the Calais area

		USA: Authorities must stop criminalizing humanitarian aid  
	","
		The U.S. Department of Justice should immediately drop all criminal charges against humanitarian volunteer Dr. Scott Warren, and stop criminalizing humanitarian aid, Amnesty International said today.
“The U.S. government is legally required to prevent the arbitrary deaths of migrants and asylum seekers in border areas. Yet instead, authorities have willfully destroyed humanitarian aid provisions in deadly desert terrain and are criminally prosecuting humanitarian volunteers in order to deter them from saving lives,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.  
The U.S. government is prosecuting Dr. Warren for allegedly “harbouring” two undocumented migrants by providing them with humanitarian aid in the form of food, water, and clean clothing, in the desert town of Ajo, Arizona, where he lives. If convicted on all three criminal charges against him, Dr. Warren could face up to 20 years in prison. His felony trial is scheduled to begin on 29 May.

	
	
		Authorities have willfully destroyed humanitarian aid provisions in deadly desert terrain and are criminally prosecuting humanitarian volunteers in order to deter them from saving lives.
	

		
			Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International
		
Amnesty International has sent an open letter to U.S. authorities as part of an international campaign calling for the charges against Dr. Warren to be dropped.
“Providing humanitarian aid is never a crime. If Dr. Warren were convicted and imprisoned on these absurd charges, he would be a prisoner of conscience, detained for his volunteer activities motivated by humanitarian principles and his religious beliefs,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“Amnesty International opposed similar criminal prosecutions of humanitarian volunteers in Arizona 15 years ago, and we will continue to do so as long as necessary, until the government stops abusing its power. The U.S. government should immediately adopt and implement exemptions from criminal prosecution under ‘smuggling’ and ‘harboring’ charges, for the provision of humanitarian aid.”
Earlier in 2019, Dr. Warren and eight other volunteers with the organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes were also prosecuted for misdemeanor charges of littering and trespassing, specifically for leaving water and other humanitarian aid in desert areas where migrants have frequently died.

Arizona has the deadliest border area in the USA, accounting for 38.3 percent of the 7,242 border deaths recorded by U.S. border authorities over the last 20 years. The actual number of deaths is likely higher, as local media and organizations have sometimes counted more than official statistics, and border authorities have not always registered or collected the remains of bodies reported to them by volunteers.
Amnesty International acknowledges the volunteer activities of Dr. Warren and his associated organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes, as vital humanitarian aid directed at upholding the right to life and preventing the deaths of migrants and asylum seekers in the Sonoran Desert.

		Venezuela: Amnesty International launches campaign to protect those fleeing the human rights crisis
	","
		The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean must not impose barriers that hinder the entry of people fleeing the human rights crisis in Venezuela, nor return anyone to that country given the risk they run of suffering human rights violations, said Amnesty International today on the launch of its Welcome Venezuela campaign. 
“When denouncing the very serious crisis afflicting Venezuela, the states of our region must be consistent in their words and guarantee to protect all those fleeing the country. The ‘Welcome Venezuela’ campaign is our way of recognizing the serious nature of the human rights violations that are a daily occurrence in Venezuela and of reiterating our commitment to the victims, both inside and outside the country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“Venezuelans require international protection. They must be able to request refugee status or other alternative mechanisms to regularize their stay without restriction or delay, and they must have access to health services, education, work and other public services without discrimination. They must under no circumstances be returned to Venezuela.”

The human rights crisis in Venezuela continues to increase and deepen, affecting the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of millions of people. According to the UN, 3.7 million people have left Venezuela in the last few years, and at least 7 million are now in need of humanitarian assistance inside the country.
With the launch of Welcome Venezuela, Amnesty International is highlighting the fact that the crisis requires immediate action to address the most urgent needs of the people in Venezuela. Any solution or action to tackle the crisis must be consistent with international obligations to respect and protect human rights and the victims must always remain the focus of the discussions.
The leaders of the region’s other countries must support efforts to ensure access to justice and accountability for the human rights crisis and recognize the rights of people fleeing Venezuela in search of international protection.

“The Libyan government must immediately release all migrants and refugees from these horrific detention centres where they are held illegally and face appalling abuse and torture.

Background:
On 4 April, the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army, under General Khalifa Haftar’s command, launched an offensive to take control of Tripoli. Since then fighting has intensified between his forces and militias aligned with Libya’s internationally recognized Government of National Accord.
Around 3,000 migrants and refugees are trapped in detention centres in Abu Salim, Gharyan and Qasr bin Ghasher, close to the fighting.  To date, UNHCR has been able to facilitate the relocation of 150 refugees from the Ain Zara detention centre to its Gathering and Departure Facility. UNHCR said its efforts to secure additional transfers of refugees from other detention centres have been hampered by access and security challenges.
At least 18,250 people have been displaced by the armed clashes with 48 civilian casualties confirmed by the United Nations, including 13 civilians killed and others injured.
On Friday 12 April, UNHCR issued an urgent appeal calling for the immediate release of refugees and migrants from detention centres in view of the worsening security situation.
The Libyan Coast Guard has returned at least 19 refugees and migrants since the outbreak of violence in Tripoli.

		USA: Government must stop illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers to Mexico 
	","
		The US government must immediately halt its illegal pushbacks of thousands of asylum seekers at the border with Mexico and instead facilitate their prompt reception and the processing of their cases under US law, said Amnesty International today during a visit to the border.
“Pushbacks violate international law, and US authorities are forcing thousands of people who are seeking asylum to wait on the Mexican side of the border for months both before and after receiving their requests for protection. The courts are playing a vital role in limiting abuses of power by US authorities, but most of those seeking asylum still lack adequate access to justice and continue to suffer wholesale violations of their rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
From 8 to 10 April, Amnesty International monitored the hearings of 28 asylum cases in San Diego, involving 31 adults and 26 children whom US authorities had forcibly returned to Mexico under the “Remain in Mexico” policy since late January. During their hearings, over 40 percent of them proactively expressed their fears of return to Mexico.

Amnesty International identified serious shortcomings in the proceedings resulting from the “Remain in Mexico” policy, including widespread lack of access to attorneys for those forcibly returned to Mexico during their proceedings. In only one of the cases that Amnesty International monitored had the people seeking asylum successfully secured legal representation.
Amnesty International also interviewed eight adults and three children in Tijuana, whom US authorities had forcibly returned to Mexico after they requested asylum. Several of them expressed fears that they could face harm in Mexico while waiting for their hearings.
“I don’t feel safe to be here. Anything can happen, because I’m Honduran. The police here are very corrupt, and they steal the money of lots of people,” said Josue, a 53-year-old man from Honduras.
On 8 April, a US federal court issued a preliminary injunction barring the further implementation of “Remain in Mexico”, also known as the “migrant protection protocol”, under which US authorities have forcibly returned more than 1,300 asylum seekers to Mexico before the final adjudication of their asylum claims. Nonetheless, hundreds of people who are still waiting in Mexico for their court hearings in the US are stuck in legal limbo – and potentially dangerous situations.
Illegal asylum waitlist under US ‘metering’ policy
In addition to the “Remain in Mexico” policy, US and Mexican authorities are also forcing asylum seekers to wait for weeks or months on an illegal asylum waitlist before allowing them to request protection, which some said has put them in danger.
Manuel, a 29-year-old man from El Salvador who was forcibly returned to Mexico after requesting asylum, said Mexican police detained him and stole his money and phone the day before his number came up on the illegal waitlist, after weeks of waiting his turn in Tijuana.
The waitlist is held by a small group of asylum seekers during the day, and then by Mexican authorities at night. As of 9 April, there were approximately 4,460 names on the list in Tijuana, approximately 40 to 45 percent of whom were Mexican nationals, whom neither US nor Mexican officials can legally prohibit from requesting asylum at the US border.

			Josue, a 53-year-old man from Honduras
		
By forcing thousands of Mexican nationals to wait in Mexico for weeks or months before allowing them to enter the United States to request protection, the US government is violating its national asylum laws. The Mexican government is also violating Article 11 of its Constitution (guaranteeing its citizens’ freedom of movement) by preventing Mexican nationals from reaching the border to present themselves for asylum, while both countries are violating their obligations under international law.
From 8 to 10 April, Amnesty International interviewed 15 asylum seekers who had been waiting on the illegal asylum waitlist for periods ranging from a few hours to several months.
Cindy, a 17-year-old mother who was seven months pregnant, had been waiting in Tijuana for over two months to request asylum at the US border, after fleeing from threats and violence in her home state of Michoacán, Mexico. “I feel unsafe and afraid to stay here,” she said. Soon after she fled, Cindy had had started receiving threatening phone calls from her aggressors in Michoacán.
Three transgender women from El Salvador and Honduras told Amnesty international they were afraid to wait in Tijuana before requesting asylum in the United States, because Mexican police had previously attacked and exploited them.
Pamela, a 29-year old trans woman from El Salvador, said she was “very afraid” of waiting in Tijuana. “Since I’ve been attacked and assaulted by the Mexican police in Mexico City, I wouldn’t feel safe going to the police if I were attacked by people here in Tijuana. They say Tijuana is a very dangerous place, and I’m afraid to go walk around in the streets by myself.”

Pastor Valley was questioned by police in February 2018 after they turned up at his church in Le Locle in the middle of the Sunday sermon.
He was charged, under Article 116 of the Swiss Foreigners and Integration Law, with ‘the facilitation of the illegal stay of a citizen from Togo, through the provision of shelter and money. If indicted, Pastor Valley would have to face a criminal trial.

		The international community must support Costa Rica in its efforts to receive, protect and support people fleeing the human rights crisis in Nicaragua, said Amnesty International today.
“Forced migration is a consequence of the serious human rights crisis in Nicaragua. The impact of President Ortega’s government’s repressive strategies is clear even in Costa Rica,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“By allowing Nicaraguans to enter the country, the Costa Rican government is saving their lives and giving them the freedom they are denied in their own country. But many challenges remain: above all to lead a strong and serious first response to the situation of the Nicaraguan people, which is deteriorating due to a lack of effective access to rights such as health, education and work. The international community shares this responsibility and must support Costa Rica.”

			Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International
		
Last week, an Amnesty International delegation, comprised of the Amnesty International Spain director, Esteban Beltrán; the Americas director, Erika Guevara-Rosas; and the researcher for Central America, Astrid Valencia, traveled to Costa Rica to meet with groups of Nicaraguans who had to leave the country due to the crisis, including peasant farmers, human rights defenders, journalists and victims of human rights violations.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are approximately 42,000 Nicaraguans in need of international protection in Costa Rica, of whom 23,000 have begun the process of applying for refugee status in the country.
Amnesty International representatives visited San José’s La Carpio neighborhood, where they talked with Nicaraguan families who had to leave because of Operation Cleanup, a repressive clampdown against people protesting the Daniel Ortega government. The delegation verified that they live in overcrowded and unhealthy conditions, without access to basic services such as education and health, and are unable to join the labor market due to delays in the procedures for obtaining refugee status and work permits.
In a meeting with Amnesty International, the Costa Rican president, Carlos Alvarado, pledged to design and approve a plan of action to attend to Nicaraguans in need of international protection as soon as possible.

	
	
		By allowing Nicaraguans to enter the country, the Costa Rican government is saving their lives and giving them the freedom they are denied in their own country.

This plan should be based on the generation and analysis of reliable data on the number of Nicaraguan people in Costa Rica and their needs, and should focus on significantly improving coordination among the different state bodies involved. In addition, it should involve simplification of the application process for refugee status and guarantee effective access to human rights.
In the report Instilling terror: From lethal force to persecution in Nicaragua, published last October, Amnesty International verified the internal displacement and migration of people due to the well-founded fear of being attacked, detained or harassed if they stayed put.
The organization documented the lack of effective investigation of crimes under international law and violations of human rights, as well as the impunity and lack of trust in the institutions responsible for guaranteeing access to justice – all of which, among other factors, have triggered displacement and migration.

The stunt, organized by Amnesty International, is intended to draw attention to the suffering of refugees trapped on the Greek Islands by the EU-Turkey deal, which marks its third anniversary today.
“Three years after the EU-Turkey deal was implemented, it is vital that this call for humanity is seen not just across Athens, but across the whole of Europe,” said Fotis Filippou, Campaigns Director for Europe at Amnesty International.
“The situation facing thousands of migrants and refugees on the islands is a scar on the conscience of Europe. Anyone looking up at the Acropolis can see thousands of years of civilisation. Anyone looking towards the refugee camps on the Greek islands will see that our leaders have learnt nothing.

“It is time for our leaders to put humanity first. They must end the tragedy thousands of people are facing as a result of the EU-Turkey deal and act now to ensure that those trapped in abject misery on the islands are finally moved to safety on the mainland and on to other European states.”

Background
The huge “Humanity First, Refugees Welcome” message was projected on to the side of the Acropolis.
The EU-Turkey deal is a statement of cooperation between EU states and the Turkish government aimed at returning people crossing to the Greek Islands back to Turkey on the premise that Turkey is safe for them. This included asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants. What ensued in practice is a containment policy, trapping people in the Greek hotspots for extended periods of time.
There are currently more than 15,000 people on the Greek island ‘hotspots’, more than a half of whom are women and children. The majority are staying in overcrowded camps, many sleeping in unsuitable tents and containers, facing risks to their safety and security. The camp on the island of Samos alone houses more than 4,000 people, a number exceeding its capacity by more than five times.
On paper, the arrangement was to be accompanied by a “1:1 scheme”: a commitment to resettle one Syrian to EU Member States for every Syrian being returned from Greece to Turkey. Figures show, however, that only over 8,000 resettlements of Syrians have been carried out in 2018, while around 3.6 million remain in Turkey. In parallel, out of 32,494 total sea arrivals to Greece in 2018, returns to Turkey amounted to only 322.

		European leaders must end the humanitarian and human rights crisis at Europe's borders
	","
		European leaders must end the unfair and unnecessary containment policy which is preventing asylum seekers from leaving the Greek islands and urgently reach a common responsibility-sharing agreement for hosting asylum seekers across European countries, said Amnesty International and 24 other NGOs in an open letter, published on the eve of the deal’s third anniversary.





Letter to European leaders
We, the 25 undersigned humanitarian, human rights and volunteer organizations call on you, in the run up to the third anniversary of the EU-Turkey deal, to take immediate and sustained action to end the unfair and unnecessary containment policy which is preventing asylum seekers from leaving the Greek islands. We also call on you to urgently reach a common responsibility-sharing agreement for hosting asylum seekers across EU Member States.

	
	
		The policy that traps people on the Greek islands and prevents them from reaching the European mainland has caused a recurrent and endless cycle of suffering
	





The policy that traps people on the Greek islands and prevents them from reaching the European mainland has caused a recurrent and endless cycle of overcrowding, substandard living conditions and extremely poor access to services: the European “hotspots” continue to provide accommodation and basic services, such as food and medical assistance, well below minimum standards. The European response in Greece has proven to have disastrous consequences on refugees’ rights, including their health and safety. This has been exhaustively documented and brought to your attention through countless reports over the last three years.
As many as 20,000 asylum seekers were stranded in unsafe, unhygienic and degrading conditions on the Greek islands in 2018. Currently, around 12,000 people are still forced to live in inadequate reception and identification centres built for a maximum capacity of half this population: sleeping in unheated tents or overcrowded containers with limited access to running water and electricity, and often exposed to ongoing violence, harassment and exploitation, amid high tensions, lack of security and minimal protection.
While the number of asylum applications across Europe has dropped over the last three years, the number of asylum applications filed in Greece has increased exponentially. In Lesvos alone, for instance, the number of asylum applications more than tripled between 2016 (5,000 applications) and 2018 (17,270 applications). At the same time, organizations providing medical and legal assistance are stretched beyond capacity. By preventing most asylum seekers from leaving the islands and being transferred to the European mainland, European governments are putting undue pressure on the islands’ residents, local community resources, local authorities, and on Greece, while reception conditions, including the protection mechanisms for asylum seekers are still substandard.

	
	
		As many as 20,000 asylum seekers were stranded in unsafe, unhygienic and degrading conditions on the Greek islands in 2018
	





The expectation that most newcomers could be returned to Turkey under the EU-Turkey deal has proved to be dangerously unrealistic. According to Greek Asylum Service representatives in Lesvos, only up to 6% of the asylum-seekers arriving to Lesvos would be eligible for return to Turkey.
It is shameful that, despite this sobering reality, some European governments have been holding hostage any real responsibility sharing mechanism until returns are sped up and increased, focusing instead on deterrence policies and border controls at the expense of basic rights and safeguards. The current situation at the borders of Europe is the direct result of those short-sighted and unsustainable policies implemented following the EU-Turkey deal and the lack of aptitude and political will across Europe to find common ground on key aspects of a common European asylum system.

	
	
		It is shameful that some European governments have been holding hostage any real responsibility sharing mechanism until returns are sped up and increased
	





As civil society organizations from across the European continent, we are convinced that the EU has sufficient resources and capacity to respond humanely to the needs of all those seeking asylum in its territory. Taking immediate measures to improve the conditions of people seeking asylum in Europe and finding a solution to the current humanitarian and human rights crisis at Europe’s border is your responsibility and duty. We therefore call on you to live up to Europe’s human rights foundation and values. To that end, we, the undersigned organizations, call on you to:
urgently agree on fair and sustainable arrangements for sharing responsibility for asylum seekers arriving in Europe, that will ensure member states’ ability to provide decent and dignified conditions for people in need of protection. In this context, we welcome the recent announcement of an agreement between the governments of Portugal and Greece, to gradually relocate 1,000 refugees out of the camps.
 
urge the Greek Government to suspend immediately the restriction of movement that unnecessarily contains asylum seekers in the Greek islands, imposing squalid and dangerous living conditions on them and putting unfair pressure on Greece and the residents of the Aegean islands. To facilitate the transfer of asylum seekers off the islands increased capacity on the sites in the mainland through an improved and more effective shelter allocation is therefore needed.

		Croatia: EU complicit in violence and abuse by police against refugees and migrants
	","
		European governments are complicit in the systematic, unlawful and frequently violent pushbacks and collective expulsions of thousands of asylum seekers to squalid and unsafe refugee camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina, said Amnesty International in a report published today.

	
	
		To understand where the priorities of European governments lie, one only needs to follow the money. Their financial contribution towards humanitarian assistance is dwarfed by the funds they provide for border security
	

		
			Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International
		
Pushed to the edge: Violence and abuse against refugees and migrants along Balkan Route details how, by prioritizing border control over compliance with international law, European governments are not just turning a blind eye to vicious assaults by the Croatian police, but also funding their activities. In so doing, they are fueling a growing humanitarian crisis on the edge of the European Union.
“To understand where the priorities of European governments lie, one only needs to follow the money. Their financial contribution towards humanitarian assistance is dwarfed by the funds they provide for border security which includes equipping Croatian border police and even paying their salaries,” said Massimo Moratti, Director of Research for Amnesty International’s Europe Office.
“Meanwhile people fleeing war and persecution are beaten and robbed by the Croatian police and forcibly pushed back to legal limbo, left at the mercy of a failing asylum system in Bosnia and Herzegovina.”
Currently around 5,500 women, men and children are trapped in two small Bosnian towns near the Croatian border, Bihac and Velika Kladusa, living in defunct former factories without basic amenities. Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot offer them adequate protection or living conditions and the improvised camps are unhygienic, lacking hot water, medical care and sufficient food.
One Afghan mother told Amnesty International: “We don’t have enough food to feed the whole family, especially the children. They are always hungry.”
Bureaucratic obstacles, inadequate legal assistance and limited administrative capacity mean that potential asylum-seekers are unlikely to get their asylum claims processed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most attempt to proceed to other European countries.

This journey is not easy. Having previously entered the EU through Greece and Bulgaria and having been abjectly failed by the asylum system there, people exit the EU to continue the journey along the Balkans. In order to reach Slovenia or Italy, where the EU Schengen free movement regime begins, they have to navigate Croatia’s dense forests, fast moving rivers and, in some places, live minefields.
In the first ten months of 2018, at least 12 people drowned in the Western Balkans, most of them trying to cross the border from Croatia to Slovenia. Dozens more died in other ways. One young woman from Afghanistan told Amnesty International how, after seeing a bear in a forest in Croatia, a woman she was travelling with miscarried. “She got so scared that she delivered a stillborn baby. She was six months pregnant.”
Those attempting the journey are frequently subjected to deliberate pushbacks and collective expulsions - often accompanied by violence and intimidation – at the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, without having their asylum claims considered.

	
	
		They drove us to the border with Bosnia. They made us get out of the car one-by-one and started beating us with batons
	

		
			A young asylum seeker from Gaza
		
Nearly all in the camps in Bihac and Velika Kladusa had been pushed back into Bosnia and Herzegovina from Croatia or Slovenia and nearly one third of those interviewed had experienced violence at the hands of the Croatian police. Many described how they were beaten, had their documents destroyed and possessions stolen in what appears to be a systematic and deliberate policy by Croatian authorities designed to deter future attempts to enter the country.
One young man from Gaza told Amnesty International what happened when he was caught by police with nine others. “They drove us to the border with Bosnia. They made us get out of the car one-by-one and started beating us with batons,” he said.
He then described how they were sprayed in the face with what he thought was pepper spray: “I couldn’t see anything. My eyes were burning. Then they told us to go and never come back to Croatia”.
Sami from Algeria told Amnesty International how he and a group of other men were taken one-by-one, and made to stand in a circle of masked policemen who beat them with batons and a baseball bat. “Then they took our money and the phones and told us to go towards Bosnia,” he said.
Another man described how Croatian police took their shoes, warm clothes and sleeping bags and forced them to walk barefoot for kilometres through freezing rivers and streams towards the Bosnian border. Such returns regularly took place at night and in remote areas outside of regular border crossings.
Those caught in Italy and Slovenia are often subject to chain pushbacks, summarily handed over to Croatian police and forcibly expelled back to camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina without having their asylum claims considered.
As the allegations of violent pushbacks on the borders have mounted, Croatian authorities have increasingly discouraged public scrutiny of country’s migration practices. Attempts by Croatian public institutions to oversee migration practices at the border have been blocked and organizations working on migrant and refugee rights have been targeted by the authorities.

	
	
		As temperatures rise and the snows melt, the number of people attempting to cross Croatia will swell and action must be taken to avoid a humanitarian crisis in on the edge of the EU
	

		
			Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International
		
NGO volunteers have been harassed, held for hours by police without formal charges and threatened with criminal prosecution. The Ministry of Interior has even accused some NGOs of assisting people to enter Croatia irregularly. This has had a chilling effect on those working to support refugees.
In spite of these appalling practices at the border, the European Union has continued to allocate significant funds to assist Croatia in its border security infrastructure. The EU has also wilfully ignored the failures of the European asylum system that make these journeys necessary.
“As temperatures rise and the snows melt, the number of people attempting to cross Croatia will swell. But with Bosnia and Herzegovina ill-equipped to handle the arrival of an increasing number of people seeking protection, action must be taken to avoid a humanitarian crisis in on the edge of the EU,” said Massimo Moratti.
“European leaders can no longer wash their hands of responsibility for the continued collective expulsions and violent pushbacks along the Balkan route that are the result of their determination to fortify EU borders, no matter what the human cost is.”
Background
The route through Bosnia and Croatia has become increasingly popular since Hungary erected fences along its borders and engaged in violent pushbacks making Serbia and Hungary increasingly impenetrable.

“In the face of serious cases of gender violence and recent femicides, the Ecuadorian authorities have the obligation to protect women and girls, investigate all these crimes, punish those responsible, and implement policies to prevent these forms of violence.

“European member states must no longer turn their backs on people stranded at sea and urgently agree on a swift and predictable disembarkation policy in line with international law and on a fair system to distribute asylum-seekers among EU countries.”
 
BACKGROUND
Prompt disembarkation is discouraged by the unfairness of the European asylum rules (the so-called Dublin system). These determine the country responsible for examining an asylum application.
Usually the country through which the asylum-seeker first entered the EU is responsible for examining their asylum claim. This forces a few countries to process the majority of the applications. In November 2017, the European Parliament agreed a radical change to the Dublin regulation, suggesting a binding mechanism to ensure that all EU countries welcome their fair share of people fleeing violence and persecution.

		Greece and the EU must move asylum seekers to safety
	","
		The Greek government and its European Union partners should urgently ensure that all asylum seekers on the Aegean islands are transferred to suitable accommodation on the mainland or relocated to other EU countries as winter approaches, 20 human rights and other organizations said today. Despite the Greek government’s recent efforts to transfer asylum seekers from the islands to more suitable accommodation in the mainland, as of December 3, 2018, over 12,500 people were still living in tents and containers unsuitable for winter in five EU-sponsored camps known as hotspots on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Kos, and Leros – almost triple their capacity. In addition to serious overcrowding, asylum seekers continue facing unsanitary and unhygienic conditions and physical violence, including violence based on gender.

	
	
		As winter approaches all asylum seekers on the Aegean islands must be transferred to suitable accommodation on the mainland or relocated to other EU countries
	





The lack of basic protection measures leaves women and girls, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) people, particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and assault, and afraid to use site facilities including bathrooms and showers. Medical care, trauma counselling, and psychosocial – or mental health – are insufficient, as is legal counselling and support during the different stages of the asylum procedure. Mental health among asylum seekers has deteriorated amid harsh living conditions and emotional distress. The humanitarian crisis in the hotspots is the result of Greece’s EU-backed policy of containing asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, until their asylum claims are adjudicated or until it is determined that they fall under one of the “vulnerable” categories listed under Greek law. “Vulnerable” asylum seekers are exempted from the border procedures, and they are allowed to move to the mainland. Greek authorities have periodically accelerated the transfer of “vulnerable” asylum seekers to the mainland but as of late November, an estimated 2,200 people identified as eligible for transfer are still waiting because accommodation facilities on the mainland have similarly become overcrowded during past months, amidst the ongoing lack of an EU-wide responsibility sharing mechanism. Others have fallen through the cracks of lengthy and inefficient vulnerability assessments and are confined to the dire conditions on the islands.  The containment policy was designed and justified as a means to carry out the March 2016 EU-Turkey deal that would return to Turkey asylum seekers who reached the Greek islands by crossing the sea, for their asylum claim to be processed there. The policy imposes unjustified and unnecessary suffering on asylum seekers, while unduly limiting their rights to have their case examined on its merits – as opposed to its “admissibility” – the organizations said.

	
	
		The EU-Turkey deal containment policy imposes unjustified and unnecessary suffering on asylum seekers, while unduly limiting their rights
	





Speeding up returns, a measure foreseen under the deal, would not solve the crisis on the islands. Many of those trapped on the islands are protected against return and could not be sent back to Turkey, other third countries, or their countries of origin under EU law. Greece and other EU countries should share responsibility to provide an adequate standard of living for asylum seekers, guaranteeing their subsistence and protecting their physical and mental health throughout a fair and efficient asylum procedure. A recent pledge to move 6,000 asylum seekers to the mainland to provide them with an adequate standard of living is a first step, albeit not one that can ensure sustainability in the long-term. Greece, with the support of EU institutions and countries, should end its inhumane containment policy and facilitate the transfer of asylum seekers from the Aegean islands. Special care should be given to the needs of children, women survivors of violence, pregnant women and new mothers, and LGBT+ people, among other groups. European governments should be ready promptly to relocate asylum seekers from Greece and ensure their access to adequate living conditions while their asylum applications are being processed. Portugal’s recent agreement to transfer 100 asylum seekers and potentially up to 1,000 through 2019 is a positive step that other EU countries should follow.

	
	
		Women, men, and children seeking protection in Europe should not be forced to spend another winter in squalid and unsafe camps
	





 EU governments should follow the lead of the European Parliament in reaching an agreement on a functioning and fairer EU asylum system, which supports Member States, including through a mandatory distribution mechanism; protects people in need; and enables families to reunite in the EU. The Greek and European authorities should show genuine, humane leadership in addressing the deplorable conditions for the people trapped on the Greek islands. Women, men, and children seeking protection in Europe should be treated in accordance with their rights and not be forced to spend another winter in squalid and unsafe camps.

		Americas: US government endangers asylum seekers with unlawful policies 
	","
		Unlawful US border policies are leaving thousands of asylum seekers stranded in Mexico, where they are facing threats of deportation to their countries of origin, where they potentially face serious harm, Amnesty International said today following a research mission last week. Conditions could only worsen under a reported deal between both countries that, if agreed, would force asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims are processed, rather than allow them to enter the United States.
As a result of Amnesty International’s research focusing on the treatment of refugees and migrants in the caravans in Guatemala, the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, Mexico City and Tijuana throughout October and November, the organization has today issued 26 recommendations to the US and Mexican governments, as well as to the authorities in Central American countries of origin and transit, to ensure human rights protections and humanitarian support for all those seeking asylum and en route, including calling on authorities to respect international standards on the use of force.
“Instead of militarizing the border and peddling fear and discrimination, President Trump’s administration should show compassion for those forced to flee their homes and must receive their requests for asylum without delay, as required by US and international law,” said Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.

“For their part, the governments of Mexico and Central America must take urgent action to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of all these people on the move and ensure they do not suffer further human rights violations. If Mexico agrees to do the US government’s dirty work at the expense of the caravan members’ dignity and human rights, it is effectively paying for Trump’s shameful border wall.”
“The danger posed to desperate families patiently waiting their turn for asylum at the border is an emergency of the US government’s own making,” said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA.
“Using teargas in a situation where families, children and their parents were present was not only horrific, it was also a new low for this administration in its contempt for our shared human dignity and human rights.”

Unsanitary conditions and unlawful asylum waitlists
On 18 November, Amnesty International visited Tijuana’s Benito Juarez sports complex, a temporary shelter where the municipal government had accommodated approximately 3,000 migrants and asylum seekers who had arrived in the first of several caravans totaling 8,000 to 10,000 people across Mexico. They joined thousands of other people that US authorities have forced to wait in Tijuana for weeks or months before allowing them to request asylum at the border. On 22 November, US Secretary of State Pompeo declared that the US government plans to unlawfully deny people that right by refusing entry of the caravans into the United States.  
Mexican federal, state and municipal officials separately confirmed to Amnesty International that the temporary shelter did not have sufficient food, water and health services, and that respiratory illnesses were spreading among those staying there.
Since at least April 2018, US and Mexican authorities have unlawfully required asylum seekers to put their names on a quasi-official asylum waitlist on the Tijuana side of the San Ysidro Port of Entry, instead of allowing people to request asylum directly at the border. The list is jointly coordinated by the asylum seekers themselves and Mexican authorities, in response to US limits on the number of asylum seekers they will receive each day. People seeking asylum without identity documents are prohibited from joining the list of those waiting to request asylum, and if they miss the day their number is called, they risk losing their places entirely.
By turning away asylum-seekers at ports of entry, US authorities are violating their right to seek asylum from persecution and manufacturing an emergency along the border. This queue along the border exposes people who seek asylum to risks of detention and deportation by Mexican immigration officials, and exploitation by criminal gangs.
On 21 November, Amnesty International reviewed the list, which contained the names of around 4,320 people, including about 2,000 caravan members, mostly from Honduras, who had arrived since 15 November. Those already on the list prior to the caravan’s arrival had been waiting, on average, about five weeks in Tijuana before US authorities started processing their asylum claims. Officials from Mexico’s National Institute of Migration (INM) and a Tijuana municipal official told Amnesty International that Mexican nationals comprised approximately 80 percent of those seeking asylum before the caravan arrived.
Mexican authorities cannot lawfully prevent people from exiting the country and seeking asylum at the US border. Yet Amnesty International confirmed with multiple sources in the Mexican government that Mexican immigration officials routinely take possession of the waitlist each night, and coordinate with US border authorities on how many asylum seekers from the list will be received each day. Amnesty International has received reports from Mexican officials speaking anonymously that raise doubts as to the supposed lack of capacity by US authorities to receive more people and indicate the pressure that the US government exercises on Mexican authorities to restrict entry of asylum seekers.
Mexican officials and asylum seekers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry told Amnesty International that US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials there were recently accepting 30 to 70 asylum applications per day. On 16 November, CBP’s San Ysidro Port Director told the Washington Post his staff could process 90 to 100 asylum seekers per day, provided that US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) took custody within 72 hours of those asylum seekers whom they processed.
In a meeting with Amnesty International on 20 November, ICE officials declined to answer whether they were taking custody of asylum seekers in a timely fashion or faced any capacity constraints due to the recent arrival of the caravans, before abruptly ending the meeting.
Amnesty International calls on the US authorities to immediately respect people’s right to claim asylum both at and between official ports of entry. Following the US government’s declarations that they plan to unlawfully deny people in the caravans that right, Congress should decline to fund CBP operations absent rigorous congressional oversight of those operations and a written commitment from CBP to halt the illegal pushbacks of asylum-seekers both at and between US ports of entry. Amnesty International documented these pushbacks in a recent report.
People seeking asylum face risk of deportation by Mexican authorities
On 19 November, Tijuana’s municipal police force announced that it had detained 34 caravan members for “public disorder” (including drinking beer on the street) and transferred them to INM for potential deportation. Amnesty International immediately asked INM to facilitate its access to interview the detainees, after receiving unverified reports that Tijuana’s municipal police may have racially profiled, entrapped and/or extorted some of them, and that their detentions may have resulted in their separation from family members staying at the Benito Juarez sports facility. INM did not allow the organization to visit them.
On 20 November, a migrant rights expert with Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) confirmed to Amnesty International that one or more families had been separated by the detentions, but said CNDH had not yet interviewed any of the detainees to assess the validity of the charges against them. He noted that people who were part of the caravans were at high risk of deportation if detained by municipal police, since most either lack legal status in Mexico or their legal stay is due to expire soon, including those planning to seek asylum at the US border. Under Mexican migration law, municipal police are not allowed to carry out migratory revisions of people’s documents – a task reserved for the INM.
Local media in Tijuana reported on 20 November that 40 caravan members had been detained by municipal police and then deported by INM. This detention is part of a wider trend in recent days, with the INM carrying out several mass detentions across Mexico in response to the caravan, including of families and children. In some cases, the number of people detained has reached the hundreds. On 25 November, Mexican authorities said that some of those who tried to cross into the United States and were met with teargas would be deported. Deporting people to countries were their lives are at risk, without giving them the chance to seek asylum, would violate Mexican and international law.
“Mexican municipal, state and federal authorities have struggled to accommodate and provide adequate humanitarian assistance for those stuck in Tijuana, and in some cases sought for Mexican immigration officials to deport people who are part of the caravans, potentially contrary to international law,” said Erika Guevara Rosas.
“Mexico’s National Migration Institute should urgently clarify whether all of those caravan members detained in recent days have been provided with opportunities to request asylum in Mexico or regularize their status and reunify with their children or other family members.”

Amnesty International calls on the Mexican government to ensure and expedite proper screening of migrants and asylum seekers who may qualify for international protection; and provide provisional documentation to those awaiting reception at US ports of entry, to prevent them from being deported to their countries of origin while their cases are processed.
The organization also recommends authorities in countries of origin to address the factors that drive people to leave, while transit and receiving countries must ensure their health and safety, provide them with humanitarian assistance, respect their right to claim asylum, and prevent and investigate any abuses and human rights violations against them.
These recommendations are based on interviews that Amnesty International conducted with approximately 200 people travelling in the caravans – either individually or in groups, including several families, women travelling with children, and members of the LGTBI community – as well as information obtained from governments across the region, international organizations and civil society organizations present in the field.

		Trinidad and Tobago: Authorities have no justification for failure to respect international obligations over asylum
	","
		The Trinidad and Tobago authorities must stop criminalizing the peaceful protest of migrants and refugees and find human rights-based solutions for them consistent with its existing obligations under international law, Amnesty International said today.
In response to official statements from Trinidad and Tobago’s Attorney General, Faris Al-Rawi, suggesting that the country was not yet legally required to establish systems for addressing the growing number of migrants and refugees reaching the Caribbean island, as it has not ratified the UN Refugee Convention, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said:
“The Attorney General is mistaken in his understanding of Trinidad and Tobago’s obligations under international law. Having acceded to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, the country is bound by international law to uphold the terms of these treaties. This means it must respect the fundamental human right to seek asylum and never return people to countries where their lives or freedom are at risk.”
The Attorney General made the statements after Trinidad and Tobago’s authorities reportedly arrested 78 Cuban asylum applicants and refugees, who had been peacefully protesting their human rights situation in the country outside the UN House in Port of Spain, reigniting debates on the growing number of migrants and refugees in the country.
According to news reports, the Cubans detained on 16 November were charged with obstruction of the free passageway under the Summary Offences Act and sentenced to two days in prison. When asked if Trinidad and Tobago was in discussions with the Cuban authorities to deport the Cubans, the Attorney General said the Minister of National Security was the lead on that issue.

	
	
		Trinidad and Tobago must respect the fundamental human right to seek asylum and never return people to countries where their lives or freedom are at risk
	

		
			Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International
		
Trinidad and Tobago is party to the the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, which the country acceded to in November 2000. As such, it is obliged to fully protect the rights of those in need of international protection. Although Trinidad and Tobago has not yet adopted national legislation to guide its treatment of people in need of international protection, it is a rule of customary international law that a state may not invoke the provisions of its internal law, or lack thereof, to justify its failure to uphold the terms of a treaty.
In 2014, Trinidad and Tobago’s cabinet adopted a national policy to address asylum and refugee matters. The policy states that recognized refugees should be entitled to a series of rights including travel documents, identity papers, authorization to work, and right to education. In practice, those who apply for asylum or are granted refugee status are not allowed to work, leaving many destitute, and they are not permitted to send their children to school. The Cubans arrested had been protesting this situation.
“By criminalizing migrants and refugees who were protesting the country’s very failure to uphold human rights, the authorities in Trinidad and Tobago are taking a short-sighted approach to the growing numbers of people reaching their shores in need of international protection,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“Rather than locking up people who only want to rebuild their lives in safety, the authorities should build on the nation’s existing policy on asylum and refugees and put in place legislation to help it fulfill its existing obligations under international law.”
International law establishes that states must not return people to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened, or where they could be subject to torture or other human rights violations. Nevertheless, in April, Trinidad and Tobago deported over 80 Venezuelans, potentially in violation of international law.
Almost all states in Latin America have national legislation on refugees.
Background
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had registered 2,286 people of concern in Trinidad and Tobago at the end of 2017. The majority were Venezuelans, with Cubans representing the second largest group of asylum applicants.
Amnesty International has documented severe restrictions on the right to freedom of expression in Cuba for decades, while tens of thousands of Cubans have left their homeland in recent years. Amnesty International’s report, Your Mind is in Prison, published in 2017 and based on interviews with over 60 Cuban migrants, documents Cuba’s ongoing mechanisms of control over freedom of expression in the country and the risks faced by Cubans who dare to speak out.
In March, Amnesty International released Emergency Exit, which documented how violations of the right to health, as well as difficulties accessing food and other basic services, are putting thousands of people’s lives at risk in Venezuela and fuelling a regional forced migration crisis.
In September, Amnesty International published an open letter to regional governments calling on them and the international community to agree on urgent measures to guarantee the rights of Venezuelans needing international protection. It also issued a report detailing the failure of the Curaçao government to establish effective procedures for people seeking asylum in light of the growing number of Venezuelan nationals in need of international protection.

		Cruel European migration policies leave refugees trapped in Libya with no way out
	","
		A year after shocking images purporting to show human beings being bought and sold in Libya caused a global outcry, the situation for migrants and refugees in the country remains bleak and in some respects has worsened, said Amnesty International. 
Findings published by the organization today highlight how EU member states’ policies to curb migration, as well as their failure to provide sufficient resettlement places for refugees, continue to fuel a cycle of abuse by trapping thousands of migrants and refugees in appalling conditions in Libyan detention centres.
“One year after video footage showing human beings being bought and sold like merchandise shocked the world, the situation for refugees and migrants in Libya remains bleak,” said Heba Morayef, Middle East and North Africa Director for Amnesty International.
“Cruel policies by EU states to stop people arriving on European shores, coupled with their woefully insufficient support to help refugees reach safety through regular routes, means that thousands of men, women and children are trapped in Libya facing horrific abuses with no way out.”
Migrants and refugees in Libyan detention centres are routinely exposed to torture, extortion and rape.

			Heba Morayef, Amnesty International's Director for the Middle East and North Africa
		
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has registered 56,442 refugees and asylum seekers in Libya and has repeatedly called on European and other governments to offer resettlement to refugees stranded in Libya, including through evacuation to Niger. However, only 3,886 resettlement places have been pledged by 12 countries and in total just 1,140 refugees have been resettled from Libya and Niger so far. Italy separately evacuated 312 asylum seekers from Libya directly to Italy between December 2017 and February 2018, but no further evacuations took place until the resettlement of 44 refugees on 7 November.
Over the past two years EU member states have put in place a series of measures to block migration across the central Mediterranean, boosting the capacity of the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept sea crossings, striking deals with militias in Libya and hampering the work of NGOs carrying out search and rescue operations.
These policies have contributed to a nearly 80% drop in the numbers crossing the central Mediterranean and arriving in Italy, from 114,415 between January and November 2017 to just 22,232 so far in 2018. There are currently around 6,000 refugees and migrants being held in detention centres in Libya.
With the central Mediterranean sea route almost completely shut off, and the Libyan authorities keeping refugees in unlawful detention and refusing to release them to UNHCR’s care, the only way out of Libyan detention centres is through evacuation to another country via programmes run by the UN. For refugees, who cannot return to their home country, the lack of international resettlement places on offer has left thousands stranded in Libyan detention centres.
The opening of a long promised UNHCR processing centre in Libya that would offer safety for up to 1,000 refugees by allowing them to relocate from the abusive detention centres has been repeatedly delayed. Its opening would undoubtedly be a positive step, but it would only assist a small proportion of refugees in detention and does not offer a sustainable solution.
""At the same time as doing their utmost to stop sea crossings and helping the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept people at sea and send them back to notorious detention centres, European governments have catastrophically failed to offer other routes out of the country for those most in need,” said Heba Morayef. 
“While Europe fails to extend the desperately needed lifeline to save those stuck in Libya and at risk of abuse, it is time that the Libyan authorities take responsibility for their atrocious policies of unlawful detention and protect the human rights of all people in their territory.""
Armed clashes in Tripoli between August and September this year have also made the situation for refugees and migrants more dangerous. Some of those held in detention centres have been wounded by stray bullets. There have also been instances where detention centre guards have fled to escape rocket attacks leaving thousands of inmates locked up without food or water.
The publication of Amnesty’s findings is timed to coincide with a meeting of Libyan and other world leaders in the Italian city of Palermo on 12 and 13 November. This international conference is intended to find solutions to break the political stalemate in Libya. Amnesty International is calling on all those taking part in the conference to ensure that human rights of all people in the country, including refugees and migrants, are placed at the centre of their negotiations.

		USA: Trump’s proclamation to restrict the rights of people seeking asylum
	","
		In response to President Trump’s Proclamation to limit the rights of people seeking asylum along the Southern border, Amnesty International´s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo said:
“President Trump’s Proclamation is yet another attempt to destroy the United States´ long tradition to guarantee the fundamental human right to seek protection from life-threatening fear and persecution. Asylum is not a loophole, it is a lifeline. This policy needlessly places the lives of thousands of people in danger. U.S law states that any individual can seek asylum, whether or not they are at an official point of entry.

“Beyond Trump’s dehumanizing rhetoric are mothers, fathers, and children fleeing extremely dangerous situations enduring a perilous journey because they’ve had no choice but to leave their home.”
Amnesty International USA´s executive director Margaret Huang added:
“I have seen firsthand the impact of inhumane and unlawful policies that have traumatized people fleeing danger when I visited Tornillo, Texas. Criminalization of asylum seekers rather than compassion has created some of the most shameful policies I’ve ever witnessed in this country.
“The narrative that people seeking refuge are a security threat is a manufactured crisis by the Trump administration rooted in the politics of hate and fear. Since 2017, Amnesty has documented that thousands of people already wait for weeks on end at the ports of entry, and others have been wrongfully turned away by U.S. border officials as they attempt to seek protection.”

“President Trump has shown callous disregard for the plight of those making this dangerous journey from Honduras and other Central American countries.

Amnesty International USA executive director Margaret Huang added:
“Banning people from seeking asylum would be a direct violation of national and international law and put lives in danger. It would be the culmination of years of hateful policies criminalizing families seeking protection and would throw desperate people back into harm’s way.”
“The people whose lives are endangered by this unspeakably cruel proposal are simply not national security threats. They are people just like you and me, except many have been forced to run for their lives from violence and persecution. All they are asking for is a chance to seek safety. They deserve our compassion, not our contempt.”

Yesterday, an Amnesty International delegation toured a tent city that has hosted thousands of immigrant children in Tornillo, Texas, including asylum-seeking children. This week, Amnesty International also sent a delegation to observe the caravan of asylum seekers and refugees at the border of Mexico and Guatemala, and document both the response of the authorities in both countries.
“What we witnessed in the Tornillo tent city only highlights the vast tragedy that has already occurred in the United States,” said Huang, who was part of the delegation. “US authorities must act immediately to speed the release of over 1,100 children currently detained there for longer than is legally allowed. We must not continue to fail them by allowing these dangerous proposals to become policy.”
These visits come a few weeks after the launch of the organization’s new report revealing the dangerous human consequences of illegal border pushbacks by the Trump administration, and that the number of families separated at the border is much higher than previously disclosed.
Additionally, Amnesty International is mobilizing its millions of members and supporters around the world to take action, including by engaging online with public comments on proposed regulations that would allow children to be detained indefinitely rather than placing them with relatives or sponsors in the USA.

		USA: Facts and figures on illegal pushbacks, arbitrary detention and ill treatment of asylum-seekers in the United States 
	","
		Amnesty International’s view on US authorities’ family separation numbers: 
There has still not been a proper reckoning of the scale of abuse by US authorities in the family separations scandal.
The US Congress must act immediately to publicly investigate and establish an exhaustive record of family separations by US authorities, and pass legislation prohibiting the separation and indefinite detention of children and families.
US authorities must reveal their full statistics on family separations for public scrutiny, ensure that all those families are reunited, and guarantee this never happens again.

    
  Tijuana, Mexico, 2018DHS statistics on family separations
In total, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has admitted to separating approximately 8,000 “family units” in 2017 and 2018, yet has also cast doubt on the accuracy of its own statistics.
This number excludes the period from 1 March to 18 April 2018, when Amnesty International and other organizations documented additional family separations.

In September 2018, the DHS agency Customs and Border Protection (CBP) informed Amnesty International that it separated 6,022 “family units” between 19 April and 15 August 2018.
CBP clarified in October 2018 that the figure of 6,022 likely referred to individuals in families, and not family groups of multiple people.
Even if referring to individuals in families, this is the highest number disclosed by CBP on the scale of its family separations policy.
Until July 2018, the highest number provided publicly by the Trump administration was under 2,700 children, separated from an unknown number of adults.
In the few previously published statistics, the ratio of separated children to adults was 1.03 to 1.00 – suggesting that a minimum of several hundred family units were excluded from previous estimates of the number of separated families.
In October 2018, CBP could still not clarify the monthly breakdown of the 6,022 “family units”, or the number of families or children represented therein.

In contrast, 13 out of 15 asylum-seekers interviewed by Amnesty International who were separated from family members, were separated after they requested protection at official US ports-of-entry.
In September 2018, CBP informed Amnesty International that all of its public statistics exclude separated families whose relationships authorities categorize as “fraud” (meaning relationships CBP deems suspicious, or with non-immediate family members like grandparents).
In this report, Amnesty International profiles the cases of five parents, and a grandmother with legal guardianship who were separated from their children despite having presented valid documentary evidence of their family relationships. 

Prior to 19 April 2018, US authorities informed the news media that they had separated an additional 1,768 families between October 2016 and February 2018, before the “zero-tolerance” policy, including 237 cases categorized by US authorities as so-called “fraud”.
This suggests there may have been hundreds more cases of wrongful family separations that US authorities have yet to reveal, more than the 6,000+ other family separations.

As of early September 2018, approximately 300 children had still not been reunited with their parents and guardians, from whom they were forcibly separated before their family members were deported to their countries-of-origin without their children.
DHS says its own statistics on family separations are inaccurate
In October 2018, the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a damning report on family separations by DHS under the “zero-tolerance” policy, in which it found “the data DHS eventually supplied was incomplete and inconsistent, raising questions about its reliability.”
In August and September 2018, CBP informed Amnesty International that it still did not have accurate numbers of family separations by US authorities:
For the period prior to 19 April 2018, CBP claimed it did not yet have “an official count” of family separations.
For the period after 19 April 2018, CBP also claimed it had not yet been able “to reconcile a complete and accurate list for separations that may have occurred during the zero-tolerance prosecution period”.

In September 2018, CBP informed Amnesty International that it did not have “a full tally” of families it separated for reasons of so-called “fraud” (including non-parental relationships, such as grandparents; or subjective doubts about the validity of the relationship).

    
  Tijuana, Mexico, 2018Arbitrary and indefinite detention
The DHS has the capacity to incarcerate approximately 40,000 people per day.
The DHS runs 211 detention centres, one of the world’s largest immigration detention systems.
15 transgender and gay asylum-seekers interviewed by Amnesty International for this report were detained for periods ranging from several months to over 2.5 years without parole, in some cases despite acute health conditions and needs for specialized care, or following sexual assaults while in detention.
CBP employs more than 60,000 personnel, as of August 2018.
The average daily population in immigration detention is projected to rise to 47,000 people by 2019 (a 23 percent increase), after a 2018 budget request.
Illegal pushbacks: Risks faced by asylum-seekers whom US authorities are forcibly returning to Mexico
Since April 2018, US authorities have forced thousands of asylum seekers to wait for up to several weeks in Mexico, before allowing them to request asylum in the United States.
In April and June 2018, the top Mexican immigration officials in two of the six Mexican states bordering the United States independently informed Amnesty International that US authorities had encouraged them to detain and check the legal status of asylum-seekers whom the US was forcing to wait in Mexico, with a potential view to their deportation.
If true, this would constitute a gross violation of international refugee law.
On 6 September 2018, Amnesty International provided CBP with an opportunity to respond to those allegations; CBP has not yet responded, other than with a confirmation of receipt.

Thousands of people from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala were forcibly returned to their countries-of-origin by the Mexican immigration agency, Instituto Nacional de Migración (INM), without considering the risks and threats to their lives and security upon return.
In a survey of 297 people detained by INM, 75 percent said they were not informed of their right to seek asylum in Mexico.
40 percent of them were forcibly deported to their countries of origin by INM, despite explicitly requesting asylum in Mexico or expressing fear for their lives in their home countries.

Thousands of members of a caravan of people from Honduras and Central America began to cross the bridge that divides Guatemala and Mexico yesterday. Several people were wounded during the crossing and tear gas was briefly used by federal police. Thousands of people spent the night on the bridge without proper shelter, food or protection. Several caravan members were transported to a detention center in the city of Tapachula, which is commonly the place where deportation buses depart from.
“Returning people who fear for their lives due to violence or persecution in Honduras would violate international law. The Mexican government should put the human rights of the caravan members at the heart of the response, and not let the US Trump Administration´s pressure  prevent it from fulfilling its international obligations,” said Guevara-Rosas
Amnesty International recently published a report that found that 75% of a group of people surveyed by Amnesty International detained by Mexican migrations authorities were not informed of their right to seek asylum in Mexico.
In addition, the Guatemalan and Honduran authorities have prevented people from crossing the border in response to the arrival of many more persons.
“The governments of Guatemala and Honduras must ensure the right to freedom of movement rather than focusing on a police response and the use of force and ensure proper protection and assistance for these people.”
Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights outlines that: “everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own.

Background 
Médecins Sans Frontières, an independent humanitarian medical organisation, were on Nauru providing critical and independent mental health services to Nauruans, refugees and asylum seekers without discrimination for 11 months pursuant to an agreement with the Nauru government. The agreement was abruptly terminated on 6 October 2018, when the Nauruan government asked MSF to cease providing health services without giving reasons.

		As European governments continue to endanger lives by forcibly sending people back to deadly conditions in Afghanistan, Amnesty International is mobilizing across the continent from 6-10 October in a series of events to demand that Europe’s politicians keep Afghans safe.
Events will include a stunt action outside the European Parliament (EP) on 10 October, when Members of the European Parliament and officials from the EU Commission meet to discuss the return of Afghans from Europe. Hundreds of red kites – symbolising the danger faced by Afghans when forced to return to Afghanistan – will be placed in front of the EP as a reminder to Europe’s politicians of their duty to protect Afghans.

“By forcing increasing numbers of people to return to Afghanistan over the past two years, Europe’s governments have put tens of thousands of lives at immediate risk. Afghanistan is not a safe place. To claim otherwise is a denial of the wholesale bloodshed being seen on the ground,” said Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International’s Regional Campaigner from the South Asia Regional Office.
“This week of action should serve as a reminder to both the EU and Europe’s national governments of their responsibilities under international law. The continent’s leaders must never abandon those fleeing conflict and violence, let alone send them to danger.”
Other events taking place during the week include the following:
Amnesty Finland will run a stunt action on 9 October to coincide with the handover of a petition to the Finnish Minister of Interior.
Amnesty Netherlands groups will join the demonstration organised by the grassroots platform ‘Don’t Send Afghans Back’ in the city of Utrecht on 6 October
Amnesty Austria will join a vigil in front of the Ministry of the Interior as part of a civil society coalition campaign to end the forcible return of people to Afghanistan (#sichersein action week)
For more details on the events taking place, please contact Veronica Scognamiglio at veronica.scognamiglio@amnesty.org
Amnesty International is organizing this European week of action in cooperation with the grassroots platform ‘Don’t Send Afghans Back’ and with the NGOs Save the Children and the European Council on Refugees and Exiles.
Background
According to UN figures released in July, Afghanistan is the second most dangerous country in the world, with 1,692 people killed in the first six months of 2018 – more than at any comparable period since records began being compiled a decade ago. Over that same period, 3,430 people were also injured. More than 10,000 people have been killed or injured each year in Afghanistan since 2014.
According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) Kabul is no longer a safe internal flight alternative for those fleeing conflict or persecution in their area of origin.
Despite this, some European countries have resumed or increased the number of forced returns of failed Afghan asylum-seekers.

		Greece: Refugee women speak out against violence, dangerous conditions and official neglect 
	","
		 
Women fleeing war and conflict are coming together to fight against horrific abuses, including sexual violence, and to demand a better life in Europe, Amnesty International reveals in a new report published today.
I want to decide my future: Uprooted women in Greece speak out, reveals the perilous journeys made by women and girls and the terrible conditions and dangers they face when they finally arrive on the Greek islands or mainland. It also highlights the tremendous resilience and strength these women have shown in overcoming adversity.
“The abject failure of European governments to open safe and legal routes to refugees fleeing war is putting women and girls at increased risk of harrowing abuses,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“And yet despite the challenges and against all odds, these women are finding the strength to speak out. Those in power must listen to their voices and act on their words. In these times of #MeToo and #TimesUp, we are proud to stand with our uprooted sisters in Greece to say, ‘We see you, we hear you, we believe you, and we will fight with you’.”

Amnesty has spoken to more than 100 women and girls living in camps and other accommodation in and around Athens and on the Greek islands since March 2017. Based on their insights, today’s report presents ten clear demands to tackle violations of human rights experienced by women refugees.
Women travelling to Europe are at particular risk of physical, verbal and sexual harassment by smugglers.
“When the European governments closed the doors to refugees, we women were more exposed to the abuses of the smugglers,” one Afghan refugee told Amnesty International. “You cannot ask the police or anyone else for help because you are ‘illegal’. Smugglers take advantage of that.”

Even when they reach European shores, their ordeal does not end. The majority of refugees and migrants arriving in Greece are now women and children, constituting just over 60 percent of arrivals this year. Yet due to a migration deal struck between the EU and Turkey in March 2016, those arriving on the Greek islands find themselves trapped in terrible conditions in squalid EU-sponsored camps.
Overcrowding is at a crisis point with almost 15,500 people living in five island camps which were designed for around 6,400 people. Thousands of people, including many with specific needs such as the disabled and babies, sleep in tents around the main camp areas. Lack of sanitation, insufficient clean drinking water, streams of raw sewage and infestations of mice and rats are common in all camps.
“Every day is getting worse… The camp is so cramped,” said one woman in Moria camp in Lesvos, which is currently two-and-a-half times over its capacity for 3,100 people.
Whilst all refugees and migrants experience the consequences of these conditions, women and girls suffer unique consequences. Several pregnant women described to Amnesty International having to sleep on the floor and having very little, if any, access to antenatal care. Last month, a woman reportedly delivered her baby in a tent in Moria camp without any medical support.
Lack of locks on bathroom doors and poor lighting mean that everyday activities such as going to the toilet, showering or even just walking at night become fraught with danger for women and girls.

One woman told Amnesty International in Vathy camp, Samos: “There are no locks on the shower door. Men walk in when you are inside. There are no lights in the toilets. At night, sometimes I go to the toilet with my sister or pee in a bucket.”
On the Greek mainland, there are around 45,500 refugees and migrants living in temporary accommodation in urban areas or in camps.
Conditions in mainland camps remain poor and this year, three camps that had previously been shut because they were deemed uninhabitable, were reopened due to lack of accommodation with no substantial improvement in conditions.
One Yezidi woman from Iraq staying in Skaramagas, located near Athens, told Amnesty International: “We feel totally forgotten. Some of us have been in the camp for two years and nothing is changing…I can hardly communicate about my problems because no one speaks our language.”
Whether they live in camps or in flats in the urban area, the lack of adequate information and female interpreters are major obstacles to accessing essential services, such as sexual and reproductive health facilities or legal aid.

	
	
		European governments must provide refugee women with the urgent support and protection to which they are entitled and the welcome they deserve
	

		
			Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International
		
However, despite these gargantuan challenges, women refugees in Greece are working to transform their situation. Women are coming together to set up life-changing initiatives, such as female-friendly spaces in urban areas where women and girls come together and can access services, rebuild support networks and gain the knowledge and skills they need to create a better life for themselves and their families.
“Thrown together by cruel twists of fate, refugee women that fled dangerous places around the globe find courage, commonalities and remarkable resilience in each other,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“These sisters are ‘doing it for themselves’, but as the situation on the islands reaches a crisis point, they are calling on the Greek authorities to stop trapping people on the islands. Reception conditions on the mainland must be improved and European governments must provide refugee women with the urgent support and protection to which they are entitled and the welcome they deserve.”

		Malaysia: Syrian man stuck at airport must not be deported
	","
		Responding to the arrest of Hassan al-Kontar by Malaysian police, Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International’s Malaysia Researcher, said:
“Hassan al-Kontar’s arrest is the latest misstep in a series of mishandlings of his case. It would be abhorrent to see him deported to Syria, given the critical situation there and the clear risks to his own safety. Malaysian authorities should respect the international principle of non-refoulement and find a humane solution to his ordeal.
“The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Malaysia should have access to him, which they have requested. They have recognized him as a ‘person of interest’ and he is entitled to international protection.”
Background
Hassan al-Kontar is a 37 year old Syrian national who was arrested and placed on remand by Malaysian police on 2 October 2018. With no option for onward travel, he has been in Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) since March 2018. He does not wish to return to Syria, where he has refused to enlist in compulsory military service.
Amnesty International’s research in Syria has revealed widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses constituting crimes against humanity including the use of torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances of individuals perceived to oppose the Syrian government or other groups.

		While the UN Security Council remains bogged down by politics, the Human Rights Council has stepped up to the challenge with this serious and constructive approach to pave the way for justice.

This move to block justice and accountability for Rohingya and other minorities comes at a time when China is committing serious human rights violations against Uighurs and other Muslim minorities within its borders. History will judge China’s leaders harshly for their blatant contempt for justice,” said Tirana Hassan.“The new mechanism mandated today will collect and preserve evidence and prepare case files for any future criminal prosecution of those responsible for some of the gravest crimes under international law. “While the UN’s Human Rights Council has today taken meaningful action in the fight for justice in Myanmar, more work remains to be done. The UN Security Council has a clear responsibility to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court. Its ongoing failure to do so is a stain on its credibility as the global body tasked with maintaining international peace and security.”
Background More than 725,000 Rohingya women, men, and children fled northern Rakhine State to neighbouring Bangladesh after 25 August 2017, when the Myanmar security forces launched a widespread and systematic assault on hundreds of Rohingya villages. The onslaught came in the wake of a series of attacks on security posts by a Rohingya armed group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). Amnesty International has documented extensively the military’s atrocities,  including targeted burning of Rohingya villages, the use of landmines and the commission of other crimes against humanity including murder, rape, torture, forced starvation and forced deportation as well as other serious human rights violations against the Rohingya. The organization has also documented war crimes against ethnic minorities in Kachin and northern Shan States, where violations are ongoing.
On 18 September 2018, the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar presented its final report to the Human Rights Council, providing yet more evidence of the military’s crimes in Myanmar. The Fact-Finding Mission called for senior military officials and other suspected perpetrators to be investigated and prosecuted for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Earlier this week, Amnesty International delivered more than 90,000 signatures from people around the world to members of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, calling for the establishment of an accountability mechanism for atrocities in Myanmar. The organization also called on world leaders at the General Assembly to hold Myanmar’s military leaders to account.

		Spain: Repeal law allowing people to be expelled without due process
	","
		The Spanish authorities must urgently repeal a provision of the so-called “gag law” that allows people to be expelled without an opportunity to apply for asylum or an assessment of the risks they would face if returned from Ceuta and Melilla to Morocco, Amnesty International said. It issued the call as Spain’s treatment of migrants and refugees comes under renewed scrutiny at the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).
The ECtHR will tomorrow begin hearing arguments in an appeal by the Spanish government against the Court’s ruling in October 2017 that Spain violated the rights of two African men by expelling them to Morocco without following international standards.
“Spain’s decision to legalize summary expulsions in 2015 completely disregards international law, which prohibits states from expelling people without considering their situation and returning them to countries where they may face torture and ill-treatment,” said Francesca Pizzutelli, Amnesty International’s researcher on migrants and refugees rights.
“Even though Spain’s new government has committed to amending the law, we are deeply concerned by its decision to seek a revision of the ECtHR’s ruling. This, combined with continuing collective expulsions of people to Morocco in recent months, raises serious questions about the Spanish authorities’ willingness to end this illegal practice.”
The individuals in question in the ECtHR case – an Ivorian and a Malian national – were crossing the border fence separating the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco in August 2014, when they were arrested by Spanish Guardia police and immediately pushed back to Morocco.
In violation of international law, they were denied the opportunity to apply for asylum and an assessment of the risks they would face if they were returned to Morocco. Their automatic rejection also deprived them of the possibility to appeal against the decision to expel them and access an effective remedy in Spanish courts.
Amnesty International has documented an escalating crackdown by the Moroccan authorities on refugees and migrants, featuring major raids targeting thousands of people this year. Since the end of July, up to 5,000 people have been apprehended by the Moroccan authorities, piled onto buses, forcibly displaced and abandoned in remote areas near the border with Algeria or in the south of the country.
“The Spanish government must immediately repeal the provision allowing for border rejections and end these cruel and unlawful expulsions of migrants and asylum-seekers to Morocco, where they can expect little, if any, protection by the authorities,” said Francesca Pizzutelli, Amnesty International’s researcher on migrants and refugees rights.

“Spain and the European Union must prioritize the protection of human rights of people on the move and the creation of an asylum system in Morocco in their relations with Moroccan authorities.”
Background:
On 26 September the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) will hear arguments in the case of N.D. and N.T. vs Spain. The case has been brought by two applicants, a Malian and an Ivorian national, who allege that they were summarily expelled by Spanish border authorities from the Spanish enclave of Melilla to Morocco on 13 August 2014, without any opportunity to apply for asylum, no individual assessment of their circumstances and the risks they could face if returned to Morocco.
On 3 October 2017, the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights delivered judgment in their favour, finding Spain had violated their rights to be free from collective expulsions (Article 4 Protocol 4 ECHR) and their right to an effective remedy (Article 13 ECHR). But Spanish authorities decided to request the ruling be referred to the Grand Chamber of the Court, which began hearing the arguments of the parties on 26 September.
Amnesty International, together with other organizations, submitted interventions in both the case before the Chamber and the Grand Chamber, offering the Court their views on international human rights and EU law regarding the prohibition of collective expulsion and the principle of non-refoulement.

		Following the conviction of Loan Torondel, a human rights defender charged with defamation for a tweeted photograph of policemen standing over one of the many people systematically evicted from informal camps in Calais, Nicolas Krameyer, Programme Manager at Amnesty International France, said:
“This outrageous decision sets a dangerous precedent for anybody attempting to document the disproportionate use of force employed by the police in Calais and throughout the country. It will also have a chilling effect on the work of migrant rights defenders and leave migrants and refugees in an even more precarious situation.
“This case highlights the harassment and intimidation of volunteers dedicated to providing aid to migrants and asylum seekers who have been left homeless in northern France after the 2016 closure of the informal 'Jungle' camp.

“Criminal defamation laws that inhibit legitimate criticism of public officials are contrary to the right to freedom of expression. The authorities must stop harassing human rights defenders through the courts.”
BACKGROUND
The tweet, which human rights defender Loan Torondel posted in January 2018 when he monitored the humanitarian situation of migrants and refugees as part of the Calais-based group L’Auberge des Migrants, shows French police officers standing over a man who appears to be a migrant sitting on his sleeping bag. The caption suggests the officers are about to take away the man’s blanket for the second time in the middle of winter.
Amnesty International opposes laws criminalizing defamation, whether of public figures or private individuals, which should be treated as a matter for civil litigation.
Amnesty International is aware of numerous reports which suggest abusive behaviour by police forces against refugees and migrants and those who defend their rights in the area of Calais.

		Morocco: Relentless crackdown on thousands of sub-Saharan migrants and refugees is unlawful 
	","
		The Moroccan authorities’ large-scale crackdown on thousands of sub-Saharan migrants, asylum seekers and refugees without due process is cruel and unlawful, Amnesty International said amid ongoing intensive government raids in the north of the country.
Since the end of July, the Moroccan police together with the Royal Gendarmerie and the Auxiliary Forces have carried out major raids on the neighbourhoods where refugees and migrants live in several cities, with particular intensity in the northern provinces of Tangiers, Nador and Tetuan, which neighbour the Spanish borders.
“This shocking crackdown on migrants and refugees in Morocco is both cruel and unlawful. It represents a worrying backslide for a government that in 2013 introduced new asylum and migration policy commitments to bring Morocco into compliance with international standards,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Director.
An estimated 5,000 people have been swept up in the raids since July, piled on to buses and abandoned in remote areas close to the Algerian border or in the south of the country, according to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH). The group monitored the number of buses that left from Tangiers, Tetuan and Nador and calculated an estimate for the number of people seized.

	
	
		This shocking crackdown on migrants and refugees in Morocco is both cruel and unlawful.
	

		
			Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Director
		
“The Moroccan authorities must immediately cease these discriminatory round ups and uphold the positive commitments taken over the past five years to respect the human rights of migrants. Going forward, it must adopt a law on asylum that will set out correct procedures and protections in line with international law.”
Recent raids and round-ups
On Friday 31 August, the Moroccan security services rounded up and arbitrarily arrested an estimated 150 sub-Saharan people in Tangier before bussing them to southern cities where they were abandoned. The local branch of AMDH told Amnesty International that the migrants were apprehended after they started a small protest in front of the Spanish Consulate to call for freedom of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco, as shown in this video. 
According to information obtained by Amnesty International about the ongoing crackdown, the authorities seized migrants, asylum seekers and refugees without checking their legal documentation, held them for few hours, took their fingerprints, and then forced them onto buses. The migrants were handcuffed or in some cases had their hands tied together with rope. They were forcibly displaced to remote areas close to the Algerian border or in southern remote areas close to Tiznit, Errachidia, Benguerir, Beni Mellal and Marrakesh. In many cases migrants had to walk for several kilometres before reaching the first urban centre from which they could attempt to travel back to their homes.
During the recent incidents, at least 14 asylum-seekers and four refugees registered in Morocco were also forcibly transferred to the south of the country, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) in Rabat. In one particularly egregious example, on 7 August, a female refugee was apprehended in Tangiers with her one-year-old son. The pair were forced onto a bus and were later released in Kenitra, 200 kilometers away.
“It is shocking to see that young children are among those subjected to these brutal punishments, as well as UN-recognized asylum-seekers and refugees as well as registered migrants holding residency cards,” said Heba Morayef.
“While the Moroccan authorities have the right to regulate entry, stay and exit, this right must be exercised in a way that is consistent with international human rights law and in accordance with the Refugee Convention.” 
The security forces have carried out particularly violent raids on informal settlements and makeshift camps occupied by migrants around Tangiers and Nador, the crossing point into the Spanish enclave of Ceuta. In some cases documented by Amnesty International, security services set camps on fire, burned migrants’ belongings and stole mobile phones.

One migrant, who has lived in Morocco for four years, told Amnesty International that the Moroccan police and gendarmerie violently broke into his house in Mesnana neighborhood in Tangiers at 4am in the morning on 26 August. He said:
""The police came in the middle of the night wearing masks, broke our door and started seizing the members of my family, including women and children. There were many vehicles outside with officials breaking into our neighbours' houses."" 
Spanish complicity?
On 23 August 2018, the Spanish authorities expelled a group of 116 people from different countries in sub-Saharan Africa, transferring them from the Spanish enclave of Ceuta back to Morocco. The expulsion was carried out a day after the group had accessed Spanish territory from Morocco by crossing the fences along the border in Ceuta.
The speed of the operation raises questions about Spanish authorities’ respect for substantive and procedural safeguards during the “expedited” return procedure.
In the less than 24 hours they spent in Spain, only 12 lawyers provided legal counsel to all 116 individuals, severely curtailing the chance that they received proper information about their rights and how to apply for asylum if they wished to do so. In addition, the lawyers were not informed that their clients were to be expelled in less than 24 hours, depriving them of the opportunity to effectively challenge their return. There was also no assessment of the potential risks individuals could face in Morocco.

	
	
		Spain and the EU in general should refocus their cooperation with Morocco, prioritizing the protection of human rights and the creation of an asylum system in the country, as required under international law
	

		
			Heba Morayef
		
Spanish authorities however claimed that the operation was lawful and justified on the grounds that the migrants had perpetrated “unacceptable violence against Spanish border officials”, as a result of which seven agents would have been injured, according to the Guardia Civil. Amnesty International considers that this assertion would not in any case justify the expedited return, nor any breaches of Spain’s obligation to provide people with a genuine opportunity to seek international protection.
Once the expelled migrants were in Morocco, the authorities detained them in the local Tetuan prison. Seventeen of them were charged with ‘irregular stay and exit’, ‘insulting public officials’, ‘armed rebellion’ and ‘possession of weapons’. They will face trial on 10 September. The Moroccan authorities are organizing forcible returns for detained Cameroonian and Guinean nationals, in cooperation with their consular authorities.
“Despite the appearance of a return procedure, the Spanish authorities clearly failed to uphold fundamental safeguards and in effect conducted a collective expulsion of 116 people back to a country where they could be at risk of serious human rights violations,” said Heba Morayef.
“Efforts to control irregular migration from Morocco to Spain are frequently praised by the Spanish authorities, who keep cooperating with Morocco to stop the arrival of migrants and refugees without conditioning such cooperation upon the respect of the rights of all people on the move. Spain and the EU in general should refocus their cooperation with Morocco, prioritizing the protection of human rights and the creation of an asylum system in the country, as required under international law.”
Background information
Moroccan authorities have justified the recent discriminatory raids as a measure to fight against irregular migration and trafficking networks. In a press conference on 30 August, government spokesperson Mustapha Khalfi declared that these are not forced returns, but operations aimed at transferring migrants to other cities, conducted in conformity with national laws aimed at fighting illegal migration. He added that the re-admission of the group of 116 migrants sent a strong message to human traffickers.

		Governments across Latin America and the Caribbean must assume their collective responsibility to protect and guarantee the human rights of everyone fleeing Venezuela, said Amnesty International today in an open letter to regional governments attending an emergency summit in Quito, Ecuador.
“Millions of people have been forced to leave everything behind and walk for days on end to escape massive human rights violations in Venezuela, including arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial executions, torture and violations of their rights to food and health,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
“The solution requires international leadership and cooperation. Neighbouring countries must show solidarity and commit to protecting the people of Venezuela in their time of need. They must not turn their backs on people who are simply searching for somewhere to rebuild their lives in safety.”

More than 2.3 million people have left Venezuela since 2015, equivalent to more than seven percent of the population, according to UN figures. The majority have sought refuge in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
Given the scale of the refugee crisis, Amnesty International calls on governments in the region to grant access to procedures for protection to all arrivals from Venezuela. Receiving countries must implement immediate and effective protective measures for Venezuelans and ensure they are not forcibly returned. States must guarantee access to human rights for both receiving communities and people in need of international protection, including the rights to health, education, work, safety and freedom of movement, among others.

“We are calling on European leaders to urgently agree on a predictable and reliable search and rescue system that ensures the prompt disembarkation of survivors at the closest safe port, upholds the law of the sea and the primacy of saving lives in the Mediterranean.

Last week Amnesty International published a briefing, 'Between the devil and the deep blue sea. Europe fails refugees and migrants in the Central Mediterranean', that reveals the devastating impact of European policies which have resulted in more than 721 deaths at sea in June and July 2018 alone.
The briefing also highlights new Italian policies which have left people stranded at sea for days and analyzes how EU countries are conspiring to contain refugees and migrants in Libya, where they are exposed to torture and other horrific violations and abuses.
Unnecessary delays in disembarkation have forced people in need of urgent assistance – including injured people, pregnant women, torture survivors, people traumatized by shipwrecks and unaccompanied minors – to remain at sea for several days.

		Op-Ed: Eritrea: no more excuses for indefinite national service
	","
		The recent peace agreement with Ethiopia presents the Eritrean authorities with the opportunity to end the indefinite national service, a widely-criticised practice that has robbed the country’s youth of their dreams creating a generation of Eritrean refugees.
The Eritrean government introduced compulsory national service in 1995. By law, every high school finalist undertakes 18 months of national service, which include six months of military training. When relations deteriorated with neighbouring Ethiopia following the bitter 1998-2000 border war, the national service was extended indefinitely.

	
	
		The indefinite national service has torn apart many families and ripped apart the fabric of society. Many children are growing up without both parents and girls are married off early to avoid conscription.
	

		
			Fisseha Tekle, Amnesty International's Researcher for Ethiopia and Eritrea
		
The indefinite national service has torn apart many families and ripped apart the fabric of society. It is common for several members of the same family to be conscripted at the same time and posted to different parts of the country. Many children are growing up without both parents and girls are married off early to avoid conscription.
Binyam, 18, told Amnesty International that his father was conscripted before he was even born. The family are lucky to see him once every six months. Some conscripts go years without seeing their families because they are not granted annual leave.

	
	
		I don’t want to have children who see me once every six months; I want to see my children every day.
	

		
			Binyam, Eritrean youth
		
“I don’t want to have children who see me once every six months; I want to see my children every day,” Binyam told us in a previous report published in 2015. Nothing has since changed in Eritrea’s indefinite national service.
Mariam, another 18-year-old, told us about the heavy toll national service had taken on her family. Both her father and her eldest brother had been conscripted, and when it was her turn, she fled because she couldn’t tolerate the idea.
In their final year of high school, students attend the infamous Sawa Military Camp, where food and water are abysmal, and temperatures are extreme. Harsh punishment is meted out for minor infractions.

	
	
		Students have come to view the education system as a trap that delivers them right into the jaws of national service. Some drop out of school to escape conscription.
	





Students have come to view the education system as a trap that delivers them right into the jaws of national service. Some drop out of school to escape conscription, but this is a dead-end choice because without a clearance certificate from national service, they cannot access food rations, or register a business, acquire a mobile phone line, a driving license, or open a bank account. Furthermore, the military conducts impromptu house to house searches to round up anyone suspected of trying to evade national service.
Not only is national service never-ending, it pays a pittance – certainly not enough for people to live with dignity and enjoy their rights to food, shelter and healthcare.
Filmon, 29, fled Eritrea a month after deserting military service. He had done seven years before deserting in September 2017. Like many Eritrean youth we interviewed, Filmon lamented the lack of freedom and absence of bankable prospects in his country.
“My salary was a mere 1,500 Nafka (US$100), which was higher than that of people assigned to the military service, because I held a civilian job. I lived with my mother who had no income. It was impossible to support her and live on my income,” he said.

	
	
		Eritrean youth have only two life options: undertake the compulsory, indefinite national service in conditions that amount to forced labour, or flee the country, risking their lives in search of a better life overseas.
	





As such, Eritrean youth have only two life options: undertake the compulsory, indefinite national service in conditions that amount to forced labour, or flee the country, risking their lives in search of a better life overseas.
Former conscripts compared national service to modern day slavery, saying they suffered torture and other ill-treatment, arbitrary arrest, and lacked basic sanitation and hygiene.
A UN Commission of Inquiry concluded in June 2016, that ""crimes against humanity have been committed in a widespread and systematic manner in Eritrean military training camps and other locations"".
In addition to military service, the recruits also worked in farms, mines or construction sites for less than US$60 a month. This system of indefinite, involuntary conscription amounts to forced labour, and is a human rights violation under international law.

	
	
		It is therefore not surprising that thousands of Eritreans flee the country every year taking treacherous journeys to Europe at the risk of being kidnapped by human traffickers, imprisoned by hostile governments, or drowning in the Mediterranean Sea.
	





It is therefore not surprising that thousands of Eritreans flee the country every year taking treacherous journeys to Europe at the risk of being kidnapped by human traffickers, imprisoned by hostile governments, or drowning in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict has been a convenient excuse for compulsory conscription and wide- ranging human rights violations in Eritrea. With the stalemate now resolved, the government of Eritrea must end compulsory and indefinite national service and allow the people to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, movement and fair trial.
The authorities must now urgently come up with a clear, time-bound plan to demobilize those trapped in endless national service, while ensuring new conscripts are not forced into national service. The government must also make provision for conscientious objection to military service.
The time to end compulsory conscription is now.

		Eritrea: Peace with Ethiopia must be catalyst for human rights change
	","
		Eritrea’s improved relationship with neighbouring Ethiopia presents a good opportunity to advance the protection of the vast array of human rights that the Eritrean people have long been denied including the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, movement, and fair trial, Amnesty International said ahead of President Isaias Afwerki’s historic visit to Addis Ababa this weekend.
Amnesty International calls on the Eritrean authorities to immediately end human rights violations and abuses, including persecution of religious minorities and forced military conscription.

	
	
		The end of hostilities with Ethiopia must be followed by tangible reforms that make a real difference in the daily lives of the people and put an end to decades of repression.

“The end of hostilities with Ethiopia is a joyous moment for Eritreans, but it must be followed by tangible reforms that make a real difference in the daily lives of the people and put an end to decades of repression in the country,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“All individuals must be allowed to freely express themselves - on the streets and in the media, including social media, without fear of being victimized by the authorities. All those detained solely for exercising their human rights, including speaking out against the government, must be released immediately and unconditionally.”

Thousands of Eritreans, including human rights activists and 15 opposition politicians arrested in 2001, are currently languishing in detention simply for expressing their views.
Eritrea is the biggest jailer of journalists in Africa, and ranks second from the bottom globally in the 2017 RSF Press Freedom Index. The last independent media house in the country was shut down 17 years ago.
Meanwhile, thousands of citizens, including children, have been forced into military training and national service, a policy that has prompted many young people to flee the country.

	
	
		The forced conscription of Eritreans, some as young as 15 or 16 years of age, is a shameful practice that has undermined the rights of thousands and created a generation of Eritrean refugees.

		USA: Authorities must stop separating and locking up families
	","
		US authorities must put an immediate end to both the separation and detention of children and families who come to the US border with Mexico seeking asylum, while also immediately reuniting the thousands of families who remain separated as a result of the Trump administration’s unlawful and damaging policies, said Amnesty International ahead of the Global Day of Action against these practices planned for 30 June.
“Despite the executive order that President Trump signed last week, thousands of frightened children are still being kept apart from their distraught parents, who have no idea when they’ll see them again. By holding kids in cages or flying them to shelters thousands of miles away, the US authorities are deliberately inflicting deep and lasting mental suffering on them in a bid to deter desperate families from seeking asylum,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.

			Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International
		
“President Trump’s order to imprison children with their parents instead of separating them is just substituting one traumatic punishment with another. The US authorities must immediately release those families seeking asylum and respect their rights to apply for asylum in fair and humane conditions. No child should be taken from their parents’ arms or be made to grow up behind bars. It’s time to end the inhumane practices of family separation and detention once and for all.”
In the executive order signed on 20 June, President Trump mandated that children be incarcerated with their parents in immigration detention centres while their asylum claims are processed. To implement the order, which conflicts with US law, the government is seeking an exemption from the court-ordered Flores Settlement Agreement that mandates that children should be released from detention without delay and within no more than 20 days.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has since issued a series of statements making clear that family separations could continue for the foreseeable future, including while asylum seekers await the outcome of their requests. While authorities have announced the intent to reunite some of the already-separated families, reunifications have been few, and many families remain traumatized, separated and under threat of deportation without access to a fair and humane asylum process.
The preliminary injunction by a US federal court ordering the reunification of the thousands of forcibly separated children and parents on 26 June is a welcome development, although the Trump administration could still contest this order. Public pressure is critical to ensure that the administration does not reunify the families only to detain them, and then return to forcible family separations while challenging the court order or in the future.
Although the Trump administration only formally announced the separation of families as a deterrent measure under the “zero-tolerance policy for criminal illegal entry” on 6 April 2018, Amnesty International has found that this practice has been in use since at least the beginning of the administration, including against people who presented themselves at ports of entry to exercise their right to apply for asylum.
The DHS said on June 19 that it had separated 2,342 children from 2,206 parents at the US-Mexico border from May 5 to June 9 under the “zero-tolerance policy”. Official statistics obtained by news media suggest that thousands more families may have been separated by the US government even prior to this policy.
“The families seeking asylum are fleeing terrible violence in their home countries and simply want to raise their children in safe and humane conditions. The idea that children can be protected by locking them up or separating them from their parents defies all sense of logic and humanity. These unbelievably cruel practices are unlawful and will leave a permanent stain on the USA’s human rights record,” added Erika Guevara-Rosas.

Amnesty International calls on the US Congress to press the DHS to reunite, as quickly as possible, those families that have been separated, put an immediate end to the forced separation of children from their parents or guardians and ensure that it does not resume.
Congress must also push the government to end the practice of detaining families that are seeking asylum, immediately release together the parents and children in detention, and reject any increase in funding for immigration detention facilities for children and families.

    
  Sergio Ortiz/Amnesty InternationalAccounts of forced separation
Amnesty International researchers visited the US-Mexico border in April and May 2018 to document the treatment of asylum seekers. In the majority of cases of family separations that the organization documented, the families had presented themselves lawfully at official border crossings in order to seek asylum, and US authorities offered them no justification for the separations.
In one case, a 39-year-old Brazilian woman and her seven-year-old son fled their home country after receiving repeated death threats from gang members, whom she had denounced for dealing drugs in front of her home. The gang members were collaborating daily with local police and said they would kill her and her son no matter where they fled to in Brazil.
Speaking to Amnesty International at an immigration detention centre in Texas, she said Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents separated her from her son without giving any reason the day after they requested asylum at an official port of entry in March 2018.
“They told me: ‘you don’t have any rights here, and you don’t have any rights to stay with your son,’” she said, in tears. “I died at that moment. It would have been better if I had dropped dead… Not knowing where my son was, what he was doing. It was the worst feeling a mother could have. How can a mother not have the right to be with her son?”

In another case, a 63-year-old woman from Honduras told Amnesty International that gang members threatened to kill her and her 14-year-old granddaughter and burn down their home. They fled Honduras immediately, having known of others who had been killed by the gang after seeking assistance from police or moving to other parts of the country.
After more than a year in a detention centre in Texas, the woman told Amnesty International that CBP agents separated her from her granddaughter two days after they sought asylum at a port of entry in Texas:
 “They didn’t tell me why they were taking her. They just told me they were going to separate her from me. If they send me back, what am I going to do? I’m going to die in Honduras,” she said. “I’m 63 years old and I just can’t take it anymore. There are days that I’m very desperate and sad. It’s been a very long time I haven’t seen my family.”

Many parents who were forcibly separated from their children showed extreme anguish, weeping uncontrollably at points while recounting their stories to Amnesty International. The organization found in cases it documented that the forced separation of families, with the stated aim of deterring and punishing asylum seekers requesting protection at US borders, meets the definitions of torture under US and international law.

		USA: Amnesty International calls on ICE to release detained transgender woman rights activist
	","
		A transgender woman and LGBT rights activist who suffered persecution and sexual assault in El Salvador is being unreasonably held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and must be released from the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico, said Amnesty International today. Alejandra (last name withheld for her protection) struggles to receive the adequate medical care she needs while in detention.
The case is especially urgent in light of the recent death of another transgender woman in ICE custody who was briefly held in the same unit.
“Alejandra deserves the opportunity to live safely and freely while awaiting the decision on her case. People have the right to seek asylum from persecution. There is no reason why she should be locked up for seeking protection,” said Denise Bell, researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA.

“Alejandra spent over ten years defending the rights of trans people in El Salvador. It is now time for us to come together and support her. We are calling on ICE to immediately release her on humanitarian parole while she awaits the decision on her asylum claim.”
Alejandra fled El Salvador in 2017 to escape repeated extortion, threats and attacks. She was sexually assaulted by members of a transnational criminal gang as well as the Salvadoran military because of her transgender identity. Fearing it is not safe for her to return to El Salvador, Alejandra has been exercising her right to seek asylum to stay in the United States. She hopes to be reunited with her trans niece, who has already won asylum in the US.
On May 25, Roxana Hernandez, a 33-year-old transgender Honduran woman, died in ICE custody at a hospital in New Mexico from medical complications. Her death highlights the risks that trans asylum seekers with acute medical needs face in immigration detention.
In addition to calling on ICE to release Alejandra, Amnesty International has asked its seven million members, supporters and activists worldwide to take action on her behalf.

		USA: Routine separation of asylum-seeking families violates international law
	","
		The US government must stop separating asylum-seeking parents from their children and denying them access to asylum procedures through prolonged detention, said Amnesty International today in response to reports of the US Department of Homeland Security’s adoption of a draconian family separation policy that will apply to anyone who presents themselves at the U.S.-Mexico border. The policy was also referenced today in remarks by Attorney General Sessions.
“The idea that children can be protected by tearing them away from their families defies all sense of logic and humanity,” said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA. “These are children who have already suffered the trauma of violence and persecution in their native countries and the arduous journey to seek safety. Why in the world would the US government institute a policy that would compound their distress by separating them from their families, claiming it’s for their own good? This is a monstrous policy that flies in the face of human rights, and should be rescinded immediately.”

“Criminalizing and stigmatizing parents who are only trying to keep their children from harm and give them a safe upbringing will cause untold damage to thousands of traumatized families who have already given up everything to flee terrible circumstances in their home countries,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
“Prying infant children from their parents’ arms as they seek asylum is a flagrant violation of their human rights. Doing so in order to push asylum seekers back into dangerous situations where they may face persecution is also a violation of US obligations under refugee law.”
Amnesty International has documented US immigration agents forcibly separating families of asylum seekers, even when they have proof of their family relationships and the persecution that they have fled. The long-term detention of asylum seekers is widely documented to negatively affect both their psychological well-being and their ability to lodge asylum claims under US law.

The attorney general has also implemented a broader policy that essentially treats all asylum seekers as criminals by prosecuting them in federal court and incarcerating them in federal prisons. 
For additional background, see the June 2017 Amnesty International report, Facing Walls, which documents how US border authorities have routinely denied asylum seekers the ability to claim asylum at US ports of entry, resulting in greater irregular flows of asylum seekers across the US-Mexico border.
Earlier this year, Amnesty International campaigned to reunite four families separated from each other at the border in violation of existing Department of Homeland Security policy to keep families together. In addition to calling on DHS agencies to remedy these violations, Amnesty International asked its 7 million members, supporters and activists worldwide to take action on behalf of the families.

“Threatening to indefinitely detain, prosecute, and deport these asylum seekers is a cruel effort to stigmatize, terrify and push away traumatized people, many of whom have already given up everything to flee desperate circumstances in their home countries.”
Amnesty International has received reports that in recent days Mexican immigration officials have detained and sought to deport Central American families from the caravan who planned to claim asylum in the USA.
On 23 April, the US Department of Homeland Security also issued a vindictive statement calling the asylum seekers from the caravan criminals and threatening to detain them indefinitely until they could send them back to their countries of origin.
The several hundred asylum seekers in the caravan who are reportedly planned to seek refuge in the USA represent a tiny fraction of the total number of asylum seekers present in the country. President Trump has nonetheless cited the caravan as his motive for deploying the National Guard along the border with Mexico.
“As the world copes with the highest numbers of refugees since World War Two, the appropriate response is to welcome refugees – not insult them and return them to peril. Pushing asylum seekers back into dangerous situations would be a violation of both the national and international legal obligations of the US and Mexican governments.”

		Manus Island: Lives at risk as authorities attempt to move refugees
	","
		Responding to the news that the Papua New Guinea authorities have sent in immigration officials armed with sticks and knives into the Lombrum refugee detention centre at around 8.00am on Thursday 23 November on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, Amnesty International said:
“The risks of serious injury if the authorities use force now is completely foreseeable. The government is knowingly placing the refugees at risk,” said Kate Schuetze, Amnesty International’s Pacific Researcher who has just returned from Manus.
“There is no justification for this action. International law and standards demand that refugees enjoy international protection. The country where they sought refuge – Australia - has violated their rights at every turn. PNG has aided and enabled Australia’s policy of cruelty and degradation of the refugees. Now the PNG authorities are putting their lives at risk.”
Arrests

    
  Journalist and human rights activist Behrouz Boochani who was arrested by police on Thursday.One of those arrested by police this morning, is journalist and human rights activist Behrouz Boochani, who has exposed to the world the extent of the abuse being experienced by all of the men in the detention camp on Manus. It is not clear why Behrouz Boochani has been arrested. However, it seems this is a deliberate attempt to isolate human rights activists from the wider group 
“The arrest of Behrouz Boochani as a so called ring leader of the peaceful protest on Manus Island is deeply misguided. It violates his rights, and sends a terrible signal about PNG’s intentions with regard to the remaining 400 plus men.He must be immediately and unconditionally released from police custody,” said Kate Schuetze.
Three other refugees are at risk of arrest on the same grounds. All these men were arrested and detained in 2015 for peaceful protests at the refugee detention centre..
“The governments of Australia and PNG have deliberately cut off services and PNG is now escalating the situation by arresting Behrouz Boochani – all in an effort to coerce the refugees to move. His arrest also appears to be a reprisal for his reporting on the human rights situation within the camp,"" said Kate Schuetze.
Amnesty International has repeatedly called for humanitarian aid to be provided to the refugees while a safe and dignified solution is worked out, in consultation with them and respecting their rights.
“The most obvious solution is for Australia to bring all of the men to Australia. They are clearly not safe in PNG,” said Kate Schuetze.
Amnesty International has long called for the camp on Manus Island to be closed and the refugees brought to safety in Australia. What has happened instead is closure of one camp, and opening another on the same island, in a location on Manus where the refugees would be even less safe. 
Background
Around 420 refugees remain at the centre after the provision of all services was withdrawn, including food, water, power and medical care on 31 October. The men have been surviving on food that they have been able to smuggle into the camp and rain water. 
PNG authorities have tried to undermine efforts of refugees to survive at the camp by stopping food coming in, sabotaging water tanks and water storage created by refugees and denying them the ability to purchase over the counter medications in the Lorengau town.
 
The decision to forcibly move the refugees is misguided. Any use of force in this highly charged environment is likely to risk serious injury. In April this year PNG security forces fired shots into the centre after a dispute broke out. Any use of firearms would mean a lethal risk to the refugees.
 
The refugees do not want to move from the new camp because they are being asked to move to a location where they fear for their safety. Amnesty International’s research confirms their fears are well-founded.  Refugees have been attacked and seriously injured by some members of the local population who have made clear they do not want the men on Manus. Refugees have little or no protection from these attacks except to live inside detention centres.

		Norway: Parliament must seize opportunity to save Afghans from the horrors of war
	","
		The Norwegian parliament has a chance to protect people seeking asylum from the horrors of war by voting in favour of a temporary stay on all returns to Afghanistan, Amnesty International said today.
“As the security situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate, Afghans who have sought asylum in Norway will be watching this vote with trepidation,” said Maria Serrano, Senior Campaigner on Migration at Amnesty International.
“We are calling on the Norwegian government to buck the Europe-wide trend that has seen a sharp increase in the number of Afghans being forced back to danger. This would affirm Norway’s reputation as an upholder of human rights that stands up for people fleeing war and persecution.”
Earlier this month, Norway’s minister for migration Sylvi Listhaug admitted that she would not go to Afghanistan herself because it is too dangerous. Yet despite the fact that civilian casualties in Afghanistan are at their highest rate ever, the Norwegian government continues to condemn scores of Afghans to fear, uncertainty and the risk of human rights violations by returning them to the country.
According to Eurostat, Norway returned 760 people to Afghanistan in 2016, and 172 in the first half of 2017.

	
	
		There are thousands of teenagers like Taibeh, in Norway and across Europe, who live in fear of a knock on the door that will change their lives forever
	

		
			Senior Campaigner on Migration at Amnesty International
		
Amnesty International has been supporting a grassroots campaign led by a group of Norwegian teenagers, who are fighting to protect their classmate Taibeh Abbasi from being deported to Afghanistan.
Taibeh, 18, was born in Iran to Afghan parents. She has never been to Afghanistan as the family fled to Norway from Iran in 2012. Taibeh told Amnesty International that she is terrified of what the future may hold if she is sent to Kabul, the most dangerous province in Afghanistan where human rights violations are rife.
In recent weeks hundreds of people have been killed and wounded as a wave of attacks have struck the Afghan capital. In recent years, the heavily fortified Norwegian embassy has itself been attacked and forced to shut down because of threats.
“There are thousands of teenagers like Taibeh, in Norway and across Europe, who live in fear of a knock on the door that will change their lives forever. Rather than uprooting young people from safe homes and sending them to war zones, European governments should be supporting them to build their lives in safety and dignity,” said Maria Serrano.
“Tomorrow Norwegian parliamentarians have the chance to set the standard for Europe and send a message that protecting human rights should be at the centre of any migration policy. We are calling on them to see sense and to vote to halt these returns, which will expose people to serious harm and danger, in brazen violation of international law.”
Parliamentarians will vote on a motion tabled by the Socialist Left Party, on Tuesday 14 November.
Background 
In 2016, according to UNAMA, 11,418 people were killed or injured in Afghanistan. Attacks on civilians took place in every part of the country and most of them were carried out by armed groups, including the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State. In the first six months of 2017 alone, UNAMA documented 5,243 civilian casualties.
The binding international legal principle of non-refoulement means that European countries cannot transfer anyone to a place where they are at a real risk of serious human rights violations. Returning asylum-seekers to harm and persecution in Afghanistan, as violence escalates, is a violation of international law.

		More than 530,000 Rohingya men, women and children have fled northern Rakhine State in terror in a matter of weeks amid the Myanmar security forces’ targeted campaign of widespread and systematic murder, rape and burning, Amnesty International said today in its most detailed analysis yet of the ongoing crisis. ‘My World Is Finished’: Rohingya Targeted in Crimes against Humanity in Myanmar describes how Myanmar’s security forces are carrying out a systematic, organized and ruthless campaign of violence against the Rohingya population as a whole in northern Rakhine State, after a Rohingya armed group attacked around 30 security posts on 25 August.  Dozens of eyewitnesses to the worst violence consistently implicated specific units, including the Myanmar Army’s Western Command, the 33rd Light Infantry Division, and the Border Guard Police.  “In this orchestrated campaign, Myanmar’s security forces have brutally meted out revenge on the entire Rohingya population of northern Rakhine State, in an apparent attempt to permanently drive them out of the country. These atrocities continue to fuel the region’s worst refugee crisis in decades,” said Tirana Hassan, Crisis Response Director at Amnesty International.

“Exposing these heinous crimes is the first step on the long road to justice. Those responsible must be held to account; Myanmar’s military can’t simply sweep serious violations under the carpet by announcing another sham internal investigation. The Commander-in-Chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, must take immediate action to stop his troops from committing atrocities.”
Crimes against humanity
Witness accounts, satellite imagery and data, and photo and video evidence gathered by Amnesty International all point to the same conclusion: hundreds of thousands of Rohingya women, men, and children have been the victims of a widespread and systematic attack, amounting to crimes against humanity.  The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists 11 types of acts which, when knowingly committed during such an attack, constitute crimes against humanity. Amnesty International has consistently documented at least six of these amid the current wave of violence in northern Rakhine State: murder, deportation and forcible displacement, torture, rape and other sexual violence, persecution, and other inhumane acts such as denying food and other life-saving provisions. This conclusion is based on testimonies from more than 120 Rohingya men and women who have fled to Bangladesh in recent weeks, as well as 30 interviews with medical professionals, aid workers, journalists and Bangladeshi officials. Amnesty International’s experts corroborated many witness accounts of the Myanmar security forces’ crimes by analysing satellite imagery and data, as well as verifying photographs and video footage taken inside Rakhine State. The organization has also requested access to Rakhine State to investigate abuses on the ground, including by members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the Rohingya armed group. Amnesty International continues to call for unfettered access to the UN Fact-Finding Mission and other independent observers.

In the hours and days following the ARSA attacks on 25 August, the Myanmar security forces, sometimes joined by local vigilantes, surrounded Rohingya villages throughout the northern part of Rakhine State. As Rohingya women, men, and children fled their homes, the soldiers and police officers often opened fire, killing or seriously injuring at least hundreds of people.  Survivors described running to nearby hills and rice fields, where they hid until the forces left. The elderly and people with disabilities were often unable to flee, and burned to death in their homes after the military set them alight. This pattern was replicated in dozens of villages across Maungdaw, Rathedaung, and Buthidaung townships. But the security forces, and in particular the Myanmar military, appear to have unleashed their most lethal response in specific villages near where ARSA carried out its attacks.  Amnesty International documented events in five such villages where at least a dozen people were killed: Chein Kar Li, Koe Tan Kauk, and Chut Pyin, all in Rathedaung Township; and Inn Din and Min Gyi, in Maungdaw Township. In Chut Pyin and Min Gyi, the death toll was particularly high, with at least scores of Rohingya women, men, and children killed by Myanmar security forces.  Amnesty International interviewed 17 survivors of the massacre in Chut Pyin, six of whom had gunshot wounds. Almost all had lost at least one family member, with some losing many. They consistently described the Myanmar military, joined by Border Guard Police and local vigilantes, surrounding Chut Pyin, opening fire on those fleeing, and then systematically burning Rohingya houses and buildings.Fatima, 12, told Amnesty International that she was at home with her parents, eight siblings, and grandmother when they saw fire rising from another part of their village. As the family ran out of their house, she said men in uniform opened fire on them from behind. She saw both her father and 10-year-old sister get shot, then Fatima was also hit in the back of her right leg, just above the knee. “I fell down, but my neighbour grabbed me and carried me,” she recalled. After a week on the run, she finally received treatment in Bangladesh. Her mother and older brother were also killed in Chut Pyin.

Source: © 2017 GoogleAmnesty International sent photographs of Fatima’s wound to a forensic medical expert, who said it was consistent with a bullet wound that “would have entered the thigh from behind.” Medical professionals in Bangladesh described treating many wounds that appeared to have been caused by gunshots fired from behind –matching consistent witness testimony that the military fired on Rohingya as they tried to run away. In Chein Kar Li and Koe Tan Kauk, two neighbouring villages, Amnesty International documented the same pattern of attack by the Myanmar military.Sona Mia, 77, said he was at home in Koe Tan Kauk when Myanmar soldiers surrounded the village and opened fire on 27 August. His 20-year-old daughter, Rayna Khatun, had a disability that left her unable to walk or speak. One of his sons put her on his shoulders, and the family slowly made its way toward the hill on the village’s edge. As they heard the shooting get closer and closer, they decided they had to leave Rayna in a Rohingya house that had been abandoned. “We didn’t think we’d be able to make it,” Sona Mia recalled. “I told her to sit there, we’d come back… After arriving on the hill, we spotted the house where we left her. It was a bit away, but we could see. The soldiers were burning [houses], and eventually we saw that house, it was burned too.”  After the military left the village in the late afternoon, Sona Mia’s sons went down and found Rayna Khatun’s burnt body among the torched house. They dug a grave at the edge of that house’s courtyard, and buried her there.

Rape and other sexual violence
Amnesty International interviewed seven Rohingya survivors of sexual violence committed by the Myanmar security forces. Of those, four women and a 15-year-old girl had been raped, each in a separate group with between two and five other women and girls who were also raped. The rapes occurred in two villages that the organization investigated: Min Gyi in Maungdaw Township and Kyun Pauk in Buthidaung Township. As previously documented by Human Rights Watch and The Guardian, after entering Min Gyi (known locally as Tula Toli) on the morning of 30 August, Myanmar soldiers pursued Rohingya villagers who fled down to the riverbank and then separated the men and older boys from the women and younger children. After opening fire on and executing at least scores of men and older boys, as well as some women and younger children, the soldiers took women in groups to nearby houses where they raped them, before setting fire to those houses and other Rohingya parts of the village. S.K., 30, told Amnesty International that after watching the executions, she and many other women and younger children were taken to a ditch, where they were forced to stand in knee-deep water: “They took the women in groups to different houses. …There were five of us [women], taken by four soldiers [in military uniform]. They took our money, our possessions, and then they beat us with a wooden stick. My children were with me. They hit them too. Shafi, my two-year-old son, he was hit hard with a wooden stick. One hit, and he was dead… Three of my children were killed. Mohamed Osman (10) [and] Mohamed Saddiq (five) too. Other women [in the house] also had children [with them] that were killed.  “All of the women were stripped naked…They had very strong wooden sticks. They first hit us in the head, to make us weak. Then they hit us [in the vagina] with the wooden sticks. Then they raped us. A different soldier for each [woman].”  After raping women and girls, the soldiers set fire to the houses, killing many of the victims inside.
Deliberate, organized village burnings
On 3 October, the UN Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) reported that it had identified 20.7 square kilometres of buildings destroyed by fire in Maungdaw and Buthidaung Townships since 25 August. Even that likely underestimated the overall scale of destruction and burning, as dense cloud cover affected what the satellites were able to detect.  Amnesty International’s own review of fire data from remote satellite sensing indicates at least 156 large fires in northern Rakhine State since 25 August, also likely to be an underestimate. In the previous five years, no fires were detected during the same period, which is also the monsoon season, strongly indicating that the burning has been intentional. Before and after satellite images strikingly illustrate what witnesses also consistently told Amnesty International – that the Myanmar security forces only burned Rohingya villages or areas. For example, satellite images of Inn Din and Min Gyi show large swathes of structures razed by fire virtually side by side with areas that were left untouched. Distinct features of the untouched areas, combined with accounts from Rohingya residents as to where they and other ethnic communities lived in those villages, indicate that only Rohingya areas were razed. Amnesty International has noted a similar pattern in at least a dozen more villages where Rohingya lived in close proximity to people from other ethnicities. “Given their ongoing denials, Myanmar’s authorities may have thought they would literally get away with murder on a massive scale. But modern technology, coupled with rigorous human rights research, have tipped the scales against them,” said Tirana Hassan.

“It is time for the international community to move beyond public outcry and take action to end the campaign of violence that has driven more than half the Rohingya population out of Myanmar. Through cutting off military cooperation, imposing arms embargoes and targeted sanctions on individuals responsible for abuses, a clear message must be sent that the military’s crimes against humanity in Rakhine State will not be tolerated.“The international community must ensure that the ethnic cleansing campaign does not achieve its unlawful, reprehensible goal. To do so, the international community must combine encouraging and supporting Bangladesh in providing adequate conditions and safe asylum to Rohingya refugees, with ensuring that Myanmar respects their human right to return safely, voluntarily and with dignity to their country and insisting that it ends, once and for all, the systematic discrimination against the Rohingya and other root causes of the current crisis.”

		Myanmar: Video and satellite evidence shows new fires still torching Rohingya villages 
	","
		Amnesty International has assessed three new videos taken inside Rakhine State as recently as Friday afternoon showing large plumes of smoke rising from Rohingya villages, one of which was already deserted, as well as satellite imagery with smoke visible over burnt-out structures.  Local sources in northern Rakhine State claim the fires were started by members of the Myanmar security forces and local vigilante mobs.  “This damning evidence from the ground and from space flies in the face of Aung San Suu Kyi’s assertions to the world that what she called military ‘clearance operations’ in Rakhine State ended on 5 September,” said Tirana Hassan, Crisis Response Director at Amnesty International.  “Almost three weeks later, we can see in real time how there is no let-up in the campaign of violence against Rohingya in northern Rakhine State. Rohingya homes and villages continue to burn, before, during and after their inhabitants take flight in terror. Not satisfied with simply forcing Rohingya from their homes, authorities seem intent on ensuring they have no homes to return to.

“The time has come and gone for giving Myanmar’s military and political leadership the benefit of the doubt. The international community must be unequivocal in its condemnation and take effective action to halt this ethnic cleansing campaign as well as bring the perpetrators to account.” One video, taken on 21 September near the village of Hpar Wat Chaung village, northern Maungdaw township, shows agricultural land in the foreground with a large plume of smoke rising from a settlement located amid a group of trees. A local resident told Amnesty International that Myanmar Border Guard Police (BGP) and vigilante groups started the fires in the early afternoon, and that there were further burning operations that same evening. Amnesty International reviewed satellite imagery of Hpar Wat Chaung from 16 and 22 September. Smoke is still visible in the later image, which clearly showed the village had been set ablaze and structures standing just days earlier had been burnt to the ground. Additionally, satellite sensors detected a recent active fire in the village, further corroborating the incident.
  Two more videos, taken from different angles reportedly outside Nga Yant Chaung village in Buthidaung township, show the village in flames on Friday afternoon. Activists, including a source in Rakhine State itself, have told Amnesty International that the burning began between 1:30pm and 2:00pm local time.
Scorched-earth campaign
On 14 September, Amnesty International published irrefutable evidence of a mass-scale scorched-earth campaign across northern Rakhine State, where Myanmar security forces and vigilante mobs have been burning down entire Rohingya villages and shooting people at random as they try to flee. The violence is part of an unlawful and disproportionate response to coordinated attacks on security posts by a Rohingya armed group on 25 August. The organization’s analysis of active fire-detection data, satellite imagery, photographs and videos from the ground, as well as interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses in Myanmar and across the border in Bangladesh, show how an orchestrated campaign of systematic burnings has targeted Rohingya villages across northern Rakhine State.  The violence has prompted more than 429,000 people to flee to Bangladesh as refugees since 25 August. In legal terms, these are crimes against humanity – murder and deportation or forcible transfer of population.  Tens of thousands of other people – including members of Rakhine State’s other ethnic minority communities – have also been displaced as a result of the violence.

Amnesty International can reveal new evidence pointing to a mass-scale scorched-earth campaign across northern Rakhine State, where Myanmar security forces and vigilante mobs are burning down entire Rohingya villages and shooting people at random as they try to flee. The organization’s analysis of active fire-detection data, satellite imagery, photographs and videos from the ground, as well as interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses in Myanmar and across the border in Bangladesh, shows how an orchestrated campaign of systematic burnings has targeted Rohingya villages across northern Rakhine State for almost three weeks. “The evidence is irrefutable – the Myanmar security forces are setting northern Rakhine State ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the Rohingya people out of Myanmar. Make no mistake: this is ethnic cleansing,” said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Director.

 “There is a clear and systematic pattern of abuse here. Security forces surround a village, shoot people fleeing in panic and then torch houses to the ground. In legal terms, these are crimes against humanity – systematic attacks and forcible deportation of civilians.”
Mass-scale targeted burning

Amnesty International has detected at least 80 large-scale fires in inhabited areas across northern Rakhine State since 25 August, when the Myanmar army launched a military operation following attacks on police posts by the armed group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). Satellite sensors during the same month-long period over the past four years detected no fires whatsoever of this magnitude anywhere in the state. The fires have been detected across large swathes of predominantly Rohingya areas within Rakhine State. While the extent of the damage cannot be independently verified on the ground, due to access restrictions by the Myanmar government, they are likely to have burned down whole villages, forcing tens of thousands to flee in terror. Amnesty International has matched satellite images of the burnings to eyewitness testimony and images of homes being torched. The true number of fires and extent of property destruction is likely to be much higher, as cloud cover during the monsoon season has made it difficult for satellites to pick up all burnings. Additionally, smaller fires will go undetected by environmental satellite sensors. Satellite images from the village tract of Inn Din, a mixed ethnic area in south Maungdaw, clearly show how an area of Rohingya homes have been burned to the ground, while non-Rohingya areas alongside them appear to have been left untouched. Amnesty International spoke to a 27-year-old man from Inn Din who described how on 25 August the army, accompanied by a small group of vigilantes, surrounded the village and fired into the air, before entering and firing at random on Rohingya residents as they were fleeing. He said he hid in a nearby forest and watched as the military stayed for three days in the village, looting and burning homes.   The same has been true of urban areas, as satellite images show how the predominantly Rohingya neighbourhoods in Maungdaw town have been completely torched while other areas of the town remain unscathed.

Rohingya eyewitnesses inside Rakhine State and refugees in Bangladesh describe a chilling modus operandi by the security forces. Soldiers, police and vigilante groups sometimes encircle a village and fire into the air before entering, but often just storm in and start firing in all directions, with people fleeing in panic. As surviving villagers desperately try to leave the area, security forces torch houses using petrol or shoulder-fired rocket launchers. One 48-year-old man said that he witnessed army and police storm into his village of Yae Twin Kyun in northern Maungdaw township on 8 September: “When the military came, they started shooting at people who got very scared and started running. I saw the military shoot many people and kill two young boys. They used weapons to burn our houses. There used to be 900 houses in our village, now only 80 are left. There is no one left to even bury the bodies.” Amnesty International has been able to corroborate the burning by analyzing photographs taken from across the Naf River in Bangladesh, showing huge pillars of smoke rising inside Myanmar. A Rohingya man who fled his home in Myo Thu Gyi in Maungdaw township on 26 August said: “The military attacked at 11am. They started shooting at houses and at people, it went on for around an hour. After it stopped I saw my friend dead on the road. Later at 4pm the military started shooting again. When people fled, they burned the houses with bottles of petrol and rocket launchers. The burning continued for three days. Now there are no homes in our area – all are burned completely.” Using satellite-detected fire data, Amnesty International was able to confirm large-scale fires in Myo Thu Gyi on 28 August. Disturbingly, in some areas local authorities appear to have warned local villages in advance that their homes would be burnt, a clear indication that the attacks are both deliberate and planned In Kyein Chaung, in Maungdaw township, a 47-year-old man said the Village Administrator gathered the Rohingya villagers and informed them that the military might imminently burn their houses and encouraged them to seek shelter outside the village by the neighbouring river bank.  The next day, 50 soldiers came through the village from two sides, approached the Rohingya on the river bank and began to shoot at random as people panicked and ran, although there were few options for escape for those who could not swim across the river. The soldiers began targeting men in the group, shooting at close range and stabbing those who had not managed to flee. One eyewitness from Pan Kyiang village in Rathedaung township described how in the early morning on 4 September the military came with the Village Administrator: “He said by 10am today we had better leave, since everything would be set on fire.” As his family was packing up their belongings he saw what he described as a ‘ball of fire’ hitting his house, at which point they fled in panic. Villagers who hid in a nearby paddy field witnessed soldiers burning houses using what appears to be rocket launchers.
Myanmar authorities have denied its security forces are responsible for the burnings and have somewhat incredibly claimed that Rohingya have been setting fire to their own homes.  “The government’s attempts to shift the blame to the Rohingya population are blatant lies. Our investigation makes it crystal clear that its own security forces, along with vigilante mobs, are responsible for burning Rohingya homes,” said Tirana Hassan. Amnesty International has also received credible reports of Rohingya militants burning the homes of ethnic Rakhine and other minorities, however, the organization has so far been unable to verify or corroborate these.
Hundreds of thousands on the run

    
  Rohingya fleeing ethnic cleansing in Myanmar's northern Rakhine State arrive on a beach on Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. © Amnesty InternationalThe United Nations estimates that violence and burning of villages has forced more than 370,000 people to flee from Myanmar’s Rakhine State into Bangladesh since 25 August. Tens of thousands more are likely displaced and on the run inside the state. This is on top of some 87,000 people estimated to have fled in late 2016 and early 2017 during a large-scale military operation in the state.  “The numbers speak for themselves – it is no exaggeration to say that almost half a million Rohingya have had to flee their homes in just under a year. The crimes committed by security forces must be investigated and perpetrators held to account. Ultimately, Myanmar must also end the systematic discrimination of Rohingya which lies at the heart of the current crisis,” said Tirana Hassan.

		Myanmar: New landmine blasts point to deliberate targeting of Rohingya
	","
		Two new landmine incidents today, including a blast blowing off a young man’s leg, bring to three the number of known sites where Myanmar authorities have mined border crossings used by Rohingya fleeing violence, Amnesty International said.A Bangladeshi farmer in his early 20s stepped on a landmine near the Bangladeshi village of Baish Bari this morning when he was herding cattle in a buffer zone along the border with Myanmar. Witnesses told the organization of a Rohingya man being rushed to medical treatment in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh today, after a separate landmine blast near the Bangladeshi village Amtali, another known border crossing point.“All indications point to the Myanmar security forces deliberately targeting locations that Rohingya refugees use as crossing points. This a cruel and callous way of adding to the misery of people fleeing a systematic campaign of persecution,” said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty international's Crisis Response Director, who is currently on the Bangladeshi side of the border.

“This offers further evidence that this is not a problem that is going away on its own. Myanmar’s authorities must immediately end this abhorrent practice and allow demining teams to access its border areas.”The new blasts took place along a border where the United Nations estimates 290,000 Rohingya fleeing violence have crossed in the past two weeks. Locals say they frequently see the Myanmar security forces patrol the area.The Myanmar Army is one of only a handful of state forces worldwide, along with North Korea and Syria, to openly use antipersonnel landmines in recent years. The weapons were banned by an international treaty in 1997.On 8 September, Amnesty International confirmed that the Myanmar security forces had planted mines along the northern part of its border with Bangladesh on two busy paths near Taung Pyo Let Wea [known locally as Tumbro] where many Rohingya fleeing violence pass through. At least three people, including two children, were seriously injured, with all blasts taking place along heavily travelled roads.“Instead of denying responsibility, Myanmar should put the safety of people in the border area at the forefront. There is a reason why the use of antipersonnel landmines is illegal: they kill and maim indiscriminately and can’t distinguish between fighters and ordinary people,” said Tirana Hassan.

		In response to Moscow City Court’s decision to suspend the deportation to Uzbekistan of openly gay journalist Khudoberdi Nurmatov (better known by his journalist alias Ali Feruz) but to keep him in detention while his case is reviewed by the European Court of Human Rights, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia, Denis Krivosheev, said:
“The suspension of Ali Feruz’s deportation to Uzbekistan - where he faces a real risk of persecution and torture, and where homosexuality is a crime - is a positive step. However, his continued detention despite his claims he has been beaten is disgraceful. He has committed absolutely no crime and it could take months or even years before a final decision by the European Court of Human Rights.”

Background
Moscow City Court reversed a judgment to forcibly return Ali Feruz from Russia to Uzbekistan on Tuesday 8 August. However, it ruled he must remain in detention pending a review of his case by the European Court of Human Rights.
Immigration-related detention should always be used only as a last resort, for the shortest time possible and only when necessary and proportionate to the objective of preventing absconding, to verify identity or ensure compliance with a deportation order.

		Ferrovial continues to build a fortune on refugees’ despair
	","
		Spanish multinational Ferrovial continued to make millions from the abuse of refugees and people seeking asylum on Nauru and Manus Island in the first half of 2017, despite attempts to distance itself from Australia’s deliberately cruel refugee “processing” system, Amnesty International said today.
Financial reports released today show that between 1 January and 30 June 2017 Ferrovial reported revenues of €1.326 billion from Broadspectrum, its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary which operates Refugee Processing Centres (RPCs) on Nauru and Manus Island. Ferrovial also reported a 40.1% increase in revenues compared to the first half of 2016, largely due to Broadspectrum.

	
	
		“These huge figures are nothing to celebrate – every penny made from these centres is tainted with suffering""
	

		
			Lucy Graham, Amnesty International's Researcher on Business and Human Rights
		
 Secrecy around the contract for running the RPCs allows Broadspectrum and Ferrovial to hide the exact profit they make from this abusive system.
“These huge figures are nothing to celebrate – every penny made from these centres is tainted with the suffering of women, men and children who the Australian government is making an example of to deter other people from seeking safety on its shores,” said Lucy Graham, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Business and Human Rights. 
“Ferrovial has responded to criticism of its complicity in this system with indifference and denial, but the money has continued to roll in. Ferrovial needs to take responsibility for its actions – for a year and a half it has been an integral part of a system on Nauru so inherently cruel and abusive that it we believe it amounts to torture.”
Since 2012, Australia has operated intentionally harsh “offshore processing” systems on the Pacific island of Nauru and the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea. Refugees and asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat are forcibly taken to remote locations where they are subjected to cruel and degrading conditions, sometimes for years on end. 
They have faced physical attacks and sexual assault by some members of staff of companies operating at the centres, and self-harm and suicide attempts are rife.
The refugee “processing” centres on Nauru and Manus Island are run by Broadspectrum, which was acquired by Ferrovial in April 2016. Amnesty International’s 2016 briefing Treasure I$land exposed how Ferrovial and Broadspectrum are complicit in and profiting from the suffering of refugees.
Ferrovial has sought to dodge criticism of its ongoing operations by pointing to its April 2016 announcement that it would not renew its contract with the Australian Government when it expires on 31 October 2017. In the meantime, however, it has continued to generate huge revenue from this contract, and not made public how it will ensure a responsible exit when the contract ends.

	
	
		It is time for the Australian Government and Ferrovial to come clean about their plans for these islands of despair
	

		
			Lucy Graham, Amnesty International's Researcher on Business and Human Rights
		
The Australian Government recently announced that the main “processing” centre on Manus Island would close on 31 October and has told the people living there that they can move into the community or another smaller centre on the island, or go home. The RPCs on Nauru will remain open. Despite months of notice of Ferrovial’s exit, the Government has not yet announced who will run these facilities.
“Ferrovial must keep its promise to leave on 31 October. But, given the extent of its role and having had a year and a half to plan, it must also make sure that its exit is not as abusive as its engagement in this system. It cannot let the Australian Government leave people in an even worse situation than now,” said Lucy Graham.
“With every day that goes by, the situation for people trapped on these islands becomes more desperate. Refugees do not feel safe in the local community, where they have been subjected to violence and threats, and with the closures on Manus and lack of information about what will happen when Ferrovial leaves, anxiety is rising. It is time for the Australian Government and Ferrovial to come clean about their plans for these islands of despair.”
Amnesty International continues to call on the Australian, Papua New Guinean and Nauruan governments to shut down the offshore processing system and immediately bring all refugees and people seeking asylum to Australia, and ensure that all those who were granted refugee status have the right to settle in Australia. It also continues to warn others not to take on Ferrovial’s contract. 
“Australia’s offshore processing system is so fundamentally at odds with even basic human dignity that it would be impossible for anybody to provide core services at these centres without involving themselves in serious human rights abuses,” said Lucy Graham.

Responding to the news, Nicola Bay, Country Director of Oxfam in Greece said:
“This award is a strong message that Europe needs immediate and sustainable solutions in dealing with migration. It is also an award for the Greek people for the outstanding solidarity and hospitality they have been showing in very difficult times towards refugees and other migrants. Oxfam calls on European governments to follow the example of ordinary citizens and show real solidarity with people who are fleeing their homes in search of safety and dignity.”
Dimitra Spatharidou, Campaigns & Activism coordinator of Amnesty International Greece, said:
“People across the country have opened their arms, even their homes, and have shown solidarity with some of the world’s most vulnerable people.  Now it’s time for the EU governments to resume their moral and legal responsibilities and welcome those fleeing conflict and persecution.”
 
Background
The “Museum without a Home” is joint campaign by Oxfam and Amnesty International Greece. It showcases real items donated by Greeks to people fleeing their homes in search of safety and dignity.
It was launched in November 2016 in venues across Athens, including at the Acropolis Museum. At the same time, the campaign’s website hosted stories and people’s testimonies that touched people’s hearts and encouraged them to become a part of this solidarity initiative.
Since 2017, the ‘Exhibition of Hospitality’ is on tour. It has travelled to the city of Ioannina in the North-West of Greece, and it was recently hosted at the regional ‘Mikser Festival – Migration 2017’ in Belgrade, Serbia.
The Jury of esteemed public affairs and politics specialists evaluated the innovation, implementation, strategy and impact of over 200 projects submitted for the European Excellency Awards. Campaigns from all over Europe have received prizes in 30 thematic or geographical categories. Oxfam’s and Amnesty’s campaign received the award for campaigns by “NGOs & Associations”.
The campaign has already received two Gold Ermis Awards from Greece’s most prestigious advertising and communications body.

		Australia/PNG: Shooting incident at Manus Island centre exemplifies the failure of offshore processing
	","
		Reacting to today’s shooting incident in the Australian Government-run refugee detention centre on Manus Island, Anna Neistat, Amnesty International’s Senior Director for Research, said:
“Today’s shooting serves as just another example that Manus island detention facility is not a safe place for asylum seekers. More incidences like this are inevitable unless the refugees and asylum seekers are relocated to safety.”

“We call for measures to ensure the immediate safety and wellbeing of all asylum seekers and refugees, including adequate medical care to those who may have suffered from damage or injury, and a prompt and independent investigation of this incident.”
“Amnesty International reiterates its call on Australian authorities to immediately halt its unlawful policy of offshore processing. Those trapped on Manus Island and on Nauru must be brought to Australia, or a third country where their rights and safety can be assured.”
According to witnesses, members of the PNG Defence Force stationed at the Lombrum Naval Base, next to the detention centre, opened fire at 6:30 pm after the camp came under attack by locals following an altercation between a refugee and a local man. Multiple shots were fired, but it is unclear how many people may have been injured.
In 2016, Amnesty International investigated conditions in Nauru and in November 2013 our team of investigators visited Manus Island. We found patterns of deliberate abuse at the hands of the Australian Government.
The Australian authorities promised to close Manus Island detention before end of October, but it is unclear what this means for the 888 refugees and asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea.

		Spanish corporate giant Ferrovial makes millions from Australia’s torture of refugees on Nauru
	","
		





A major corporation responsible for running the Australian government’s refugee “processing” centre on Nauru is making millions of dollars from a system that amounts to torture of refugees and people seeking asylum, Amnesty International said today. 

	
	
		The Australian government has created an island of despair for refugees and people seeking asylum on Nauru
	

		
			Lucy Graham, Amnesty International's Researcher on Business and Human Rights
		
A new briefing, ‘Treasure I$land’, exposes how Spanish multinational Ferrovial and its Australian subsidiary Broadspectrum are complicit in, and reaping vast profits from, Australia’s cruel and secretive refugee “processing” system on the Pacific island.
“The Australian government has created an island of despair for refugees and people seeking asylum on Nauru, but an island of profit for companies making millions of dollars from a system so deliberately and inherently cruel and abusive it amounts to torture,” said Lucy Graham, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Business and Human Rights.
“By knowingly enabling the continuation of this system, which is specifically designed to cause suffering and deter people from travelling to Australia by boat to seek asylum, Broadspectrum and Ferrovial are unequivocally complicit in this abuse.”
With Broadspectrum’s AUD$2.5 billion contract with the Australian government ending in October, Amnesty International is warning other firms against seeking to profit from torture.
“Any company considering taking up this toxic baton will be complicit in an intentionally abusive system, in direct contravention of its human rights responsibilities, and will be exposing itself to potential criminal liability and damages claims,” said Lucy Graham.
“The regime of cruelty at the Refugee Processing Centre on Nauru leaves a stain that no responsible company would want on its conscience or reputation.”
Cruelty – a lucrative business
Since 2012, Australia has operated intentionally harsh “offshore processing” systems on the Pacific island of Nauru and the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea. Refugees and asylum seekers are isolated in remote locations and subjected to cruel and degrading conditions, sometimes for years on end, simply because they have sought safety on Australian shores.
Amnesty International’s October 2016 report, Island of Despair: Australia's 'processing of refugees on Nauru' found that the Australian government is intentionally and systematically violating the rights of refugees and people seeking asylum on Nauru. It concluded that the conditions on Nauru are so deliberately cruel and abusive that they amount to torture.
It has now transpired that cruelty and abuse make for a lucrative business.

	
	
		It’s a clinical, cold-blooded set-up where the Australian authorities set the blueprint for cruelty, and the companies do the dirty work.
	

		
			Lucy Graham, Amnesty International's Researcher on Business and Human Rights
		
The Refugee Processing Centres (RPCs) on Nauru and Manus Island are run by Broadspectrum, which was bought by Ferrovial in April 2016.
Amnesty International’s latest briefing details how the part of Broadspectrum’s business that runs its operations on Nauru and Manus Island contributed AUD$1.646 billion in the 2016 financial year– an astonishing 45% of the company’s total operating revenues.
Meanwhile, Ferrovial has raked in 1.4 billion euros in revenues from Broadspectrum since acquiring the company. A substantial portion of this comes from operations on Nauru and Manus Island.
“Not only are Ferrovial and Broadspectrum turning a blind eye to the human rights violations perpetrated by the Australian government; they are the very enablers of the abuse,” said Lucy Graham.
“It’s a clinical, cold-blooded set-up where the Australian authorities set the blueprint for cruelty, and the companies do the dirty work. Considering the extraordinary profits on offer, we believe it is clear that these companies are motivated by sheer greed.”
The total value of the Australian government’s contract with Broadspectrum is AUD$2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion) over three and a half years.
When put into the context of Broadspectrum’s other business sectors, it becomes clear just how profitable this contract is.
The profit margin in Broadspectrum’s Defence, Social and Property sector – which includes its Nauru and Manus Island operations – was 17.8% in its 2016 financial year, far higher than in its other business sectors such as Infrastructure (2.8%) and Resource and Industrial (1.6%).
Meanwhile, Ferrovial’s revenues in its Nauru and Manus Island-related Service sector increased by 24.1% in 2016 due to its acquisition of Broadspectrum.
A bleak existence on Nauru
While Ferrovial and Broadspectrum turn in huge profits, those trapped on Nauru endure an unimaginably bleak existence with little hope of respite.

	
	
		This is business at its worst.
	

		
			Lucy Graham, Amnesty International's Researcher on Business and Human Rights
		
Not only have they been denied entrance to Australia, they also have no idea when or if Australia and Nauru will allow them to leave, despite a recently announced settlement deal with the USA. Even recognized refugees are not allowed to leave the island.
Refugees and asylum seekers at the RPC on Nauru have faced physical attacks and sexual assault by some members of staff, without anyone being held properly accountable.
The briefing highlights the devastating case of “Yasmin” from Iran. Her husband “Amir” told Amnesty International in July 2016 how Yasmin’s mental health started deteriorating during her time at the RPC on Nauru to the point that she tried to commit suicide on several occasions.
Not only is Broadspectrum aware of the conditions faced on Nauru by refugees and people seeking asylum; in some cases, its employees and sub-contractors are directly responsible for neglect and abuse.
Allegations of abuses against Broadspectrum, its sub-contractor Wilson Security and other staff members at the RPC have included (as of 30 April 2015) 30 formal allegations of child abuse, 15 allegations of sexual assault or rape and four allegations relating to the exchange of sexual favours for contraband.
“This is business at its worst. Ferrovial acquired Broadspectrum in full knowledge of the extent of the human rights abuses on Nauru and the level of profit that Broadspectrum makes on the back of this immense suffering,” said Lucy Graham.
Oppressive culture of secrecy sustains abuse
The Australian authorities have stated with pride that they intend for the people detained on Nauru and Manus Island to suffer, in order to deter other would-be asylum-seekers from trying to enter the country irregularly.
Despite the apparent candour on the issue, no one is willing to take responsibility for operating the RPC on Nauru.
Broadspectrum told Amnesty International it “does not operate the Refugee Processing Centre”, a claim repeated by Ferrovial. Meanwhile, the Australian government claims the centre is run by the government of Nauru, which has in turn suggested that others are responsible.
In contrast, Amnesty International’s research shows that Broadspectrum runs the RPC on a daily basis and has effective control over the day-to-day lives of refugees and asylum-seekers at the RPC, on behalf of the Australian government and with the government’s ultimate oversight and control.
The Australian government has also gone to extraordinary lengths to hide the full magnitude of the abuses on Nauru and Manus Island, making it a criminal offence for welfare professionals to speak out and placing service providers under strict confidentiality clauses. 
Meanwhile, Broadspectrum has warned its staff, in a leaked internal document, that they can be fired for communicating information about operations on Nauru.
This secrecy extends to the terms of the contracts under which Broadspectrum and Wilson Security provide services on Nauru and Manus Island, the full terms of which are not publicly known.
“The secrecy around the contracts allows Broadspectrum and Ferrovial to hide the exact profit they make from human rights abuses, while the strict confidentiality terms imposed by the Australian government allow it to hide the scale of these abuses,” said Lucy Graham
No company should profit from abuse

	
	
		No company should be operating on Nauru or Manus, where the current situation is so noxious that it would be impossible for any firm to do so without contributing to serious human rights violations
	

		
			Lucy Graham
		
Australia’s offshore processing system on Nauru could not function without Broadspectrum’s involvement. Ferrovial has stated it will not renew the contract when it expires in October 2017, so the Australian government is expected to issue a call for new service providers soon. Amnesty International is warning others not to take on this contract.
“No company should be operating on Nauru or Manus, where the current situation is so noxious that it would be impossible for any firm to do so without contributing to serious human rights violations and exposing itself to legal liability and reputational risk,” said Lucy Graham.
“It’s therefore our duty to the victims of human rights violations on the islands to name and shame any company that puts profit before decency by choosing to become involved in Australia’s abusive operations.”
Amnesty International is calling on the Australian government to shut down the offshore processing system; immediately bring all refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island to Australia; and ensure that all those who were granted refugee status have the right to settle in Australia.
It is also urging the Australian government to cooperate with all rights-respecting offers of international cooperation and assistance, including resettlement of refugees to third countries if the refugees wish to be resettled and are able to make a fully informed and free choice.
The organization is calling on Ferrovial to end its operations on Nauru and Manus Island as soon as possible.
A full response from Broadspectrum and Ferrovial to our findings is included in the annex to the briefing.

		USA: Trump’s revised travel ban will stir hatred and division
	","
		In response to President Trump’s new Executive Order to reinstate the suspension of the USA’s refugee resettlement programme and establish a temporary travel ban on people from six majority-Muslim countries, Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said:
“President Trump’s determined efforts to slam the door on those fleeing the very terror he claims to be fighting will be remembered among the darkest chapters of US history. The idea that these measures are in the interest of national security does not stand up to the slightest scrutiny.
“This new Executive Order simply reinstates many of the most repellent elements of its predecessor. It tramples on the values the USA has long claimed to stand for and threatens to dash the hopes of thousands of refugees who were due to be resettled in the USA.

“Removing the ambiguity about permanent residents is simply an attempt to evade further judicial scrutiny. The anti-Muslim rationale behind this Executive Order should be evident to anyone familiar with Trump’s long campaign to spread fear about Muslims.
“These are families that have escaped out of the rubble of Aleppo, or fled the bombs and the famine closing in on Yemen. They are people fleeing a security threat, and they deserve protection.

“These measures will make nobody safer. Instead they could play directly into the hands of violent extremists claiming that the US government is at war with Islam.
“The publicity circus surrounding President Trump’s every move must not distract from the fact that longstanding human rights commitments in the US are being badly eroded. The new Executive Order is wrong-headed and counterproductive, and must be resisted at every step.”

		Hungary stoops to new low with plan to round up asylum seekers in container camp
	","
		The Hungarian government’s announcement that it will detain all asylum seekers in containers near the border is yet another disturbing move in a pattern of demonizing this already very vulnerable group, Amnesty International said today. 
The government will submit its proposal to Parliament which will then debate and vote on the measures within weeks. If adopted, it will be in clear contravention of EU law and the Refugee Convention.
“Rounding up all men, women and children seeking asylum and detaining them months on end in container camps is a new low in Hungary’s race to the bottom on asylum seekers and refugees,” said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Europe.  Under the measure, all current and future asylum seekers would be transferred to container camps in a so-called “transit zone” near the border with Serbia, where they would be held for the duration of their asylum application process. Asylum appeals would by default be conducted with the asylum seeker attending only via video-link to a court rather than in person.
“By amending a raft of laws to lock up all asylum seekers, the Hungarian government will inflict unnecessary trauma, compounding what people seeking protection have already suffered. The government has in no way proven that the detention of each asylum seekers would be reasonable, necessary and proportionate. Detention should always be the last resort and not an immediate knee-jerk reaction as is the case here,” said Gauri van Gulik.
“This is further evidence that the EU needs to stand firm on Hungary’s flagrant disregard for European and International law.”
Background
Currently, people seeking asylum cannot be detained in the so-called “transit zones” along Hungary’s border with Serbia for more than four weeks, after which they must be allowed inside the country. The reform under consideration would remove that time limit and introduce mandatory detention for the whole duration of the asylum procedure.  Access to transit zones set up at the border with Serbia has already been severely restricted for NGOs and human rights monitors.

		USA: Trump’s seven first steps to sabotage human rights
	","
		 
Since taking over at the White House, US President Donald Trump has wasted little time putting into action his poisonous campaign rhetoric. In his first couple of weeks in office, he pushed through a series of repressive executive orders that threaten the human rights of millions at home and abroad. Here are seven potentially devastating steps already taken by President Trump:
Turning his back on refugees
One week into his administration, Trump suspended the country’s refugee programme for 120 days, implemented an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and introduced an annual refugee cap of 50,000. The cap is likely to affect 60,000 people in 2017 alone, with outgoing president Barack Obama’s administration having pledged to admit 110,000 refugees in the current fiscal year. Amid a global emergency in which 21 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to war and persecution, the move by one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful countries to block off the avenue of resettlement is nothing short of appalling. Trump is blocking men, women and children refugees from fleeing the very terror he purports to be fighting.
Religious discrimination
President Trump also moved swiftly to ban the entry of anyone arriving from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen – seven predominantly Muslim countries. While the executive order did not explicitly mention a ban on Muslims, the brazen religious discrimination was clear – especially in light of the President’s pre-election rhetoric. There are exceptions to the ban, including for those who have faced religious persecution – but only if they are part of a “religious minority”. One reading of this caveat is that the White House will accept Christians fleeing predominantly Muslim countries, further reinforcing the theme of religious division. Having been temporarily lifted by a federal US court, Trump’s “Muslim ban” is now the subject of a legal fight. Amnesty International is calling on the US Congress to intervene immediately to block the ban.

Speedy deportation of those fleeing violence in Central America
Trump’s promise to build a “big, beautiful” wall along the USA’s border with Mexico as a means of keeping out “criminals” was one of the cornerstones of his election campaign. So it was no surprise when he signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that promise within days of taking office. One vowed to create the barrier, while another – possibly of more pressing concern to the thousands of migrants fleeing armed violence in Mexico and Central America – pledged to hire 10,000 more immigration officers. The likelihood is that many more migrants, including many in need of international protection, will be held in temporary detention camps along the border before being ultimately sent back to places where their lives are at risk.
Targeting safe havens for refugees and migrants
In the same decree that ordered the hiring of extra border personnel, Trump attempted to cut off other pathways for asylum-seekers by revoking federal grant money from so-called “sanctuary cities” that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and refuse to deport undocumented migrants, such as those with legitimate claims to asylum. Including New York, Dallas, Minneapolis, Denver and San Francisco, there are 39 such cities across the country which stand to lose billions of dollars in federal funding under Trump’s plan.
All-out assault on women’s rights
An image of a group of men in suits standing around President Trump as he signed away the sexual and reproductive rights of millions of women and girls worldwide has become emblematic of the new administration’s danger to women’s rights. The executive order reintroducing the global “gag rule” blocks US federal funding for overseas non-governmental organizations that provide abortion counselling or referrals, advocate to decriminalize abortion or expand abortion services – even though the USA does not fund these services directly. In Latin American and the Caribbean alone, where abortion is completely banned in seven countries even when the health or life of a woman or girl depend on it, there is no doubt that Trump’s stance will cost many lives. Even in some countries were abortion is legal, access is to a large extent dependent on US funding, meaning the gag rule risks the lives of people there as well.

Restricting access to health services
The global “gag rule” will have far-reaching consequences beyond its stated aim of reducing access to abortions. Many of the organizations hit with significant funding cuts also provide HIV/AIDS treatment, emergency contraception and other reproductive health-care services alongside abortion services and information, particularly in Africa and Latin America. In fact, Trump’s version of the gag rule, last implemented under George W Bush, is much broader than previous incarnations and applies to all global health funding by the USA, i.e. beyond reproductive health.
Native American land and livelihoods under attack
Trump’s decision to advance the highly controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,200-mile crude oil route through four US states, put the profits of oil companies before the human rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who have a sacred site near the route which bisects Indigenous land along the Missouri River, say the pipeline would contaminate drinking water and damage sacred burial sites. Not only was the pipeline construction approved in violation of the Native American group’s right to access clean water, the decision was also taken without consulting them and seeking their consent – a requirement under international human rights and US law. The arrests of dozens of anti-pipeline protesters last week came after police had already been accused of excessive force in their handling of previous demonstrations, and heightens fears that environmental activists could now see their right to peaceful protest under greater threat.

		USA: Trump’s policy decisions blocking refugees puts hateful rhetoric into action

		In reaction to President Trump’s Executive Order to effectively prevent refugees from seeking resettlement in the USA, Salil Shetty, Secretary General at Amnesty International said:
“President Trump’s Executive Order effectively blocking those fleeing war and persecution from war-torn countries such as Syria, from seeking safe haven in the USA are an appalling move with potentially catastrophic consequences.“

 “These men, women and children are the victims of the same terror President Trump claims he wants to fight against. The irony beggars belief. It is particularly ironic that the USA has directly contributed to the instability in many places which is forcing people to flee.
“Denying protection to people in need is not the answer to the worst refugee crisis since World War II. Instead of slamming the door in the face of those who have no choice but to flee their homes, the Trump administration should remember that the USA is a country also built largely by migrants and refugees.

		Kenya: Government officials coercing refugees back to war-torn Somalia
	","
		Just two weeks before the deadline given to close the Dadaab refugee camp, Kenyan government officials are deliberately coercing refugees to return to Somalia, where they risk being injured or killed in the ongoing armed conflict, Amnesty International said in a report released today.
The government announced in May that it would close the world’s largest refugee camp, which is home to more than 280,000 mostly Somali refugees, citing security, economic and environmental concerns, in addition to lack of support by the international community. Since then, government officials have made statements in the media and visited the camp, threatening people to leave before the closure slated for 30 November 2016.
“The refugees are caught between a rock and a hard place. Kenyan government officials are telling them they must leave by the end of the month or they will be forced to leave without any assistance,” said Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“These actions contravene the Kenyan government’s assurances to the international community that it would ensure all refugee repatriations are voluntary and carried out in safety and dignity.”
Amnesty International researchers visited Dadaab in August, where they interviewed 56 refugees individually and held focus group discussions with 35 more.

			Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes
		
Among those interviewed were two brothers aged 15 and 18 who had gone to Somalia in January 2016 and came back to Dadaab four months later. They said that when they got to Somalia, their father was killed in front of them and they were forcibly recruited by Al-Shabaab. They eventually escaped and made it back to Dadaab.
Besides, Somalia, which is currently grappling with over 1.1 million internally displaced people, lacks the necessary resources to handle a large-scale return of refugees from Dadaab. Services including shelter, healthcare and education remain in desperately short supply.
Most refugees interviewed by Amnesty International said they were only considering leaving due to threats from Kenyan government officials.
According to a verification exercise carried out by the Kenyan government and UNHCR in July and August, only 25% of refugees said they were willing to return. Refugees cited threats issued by the Kenyan authorities that they would be forced to leave if they did not go now and that they would miss out on the allowance UNHCR gives, as reasons to leave. 
Hadi, who has lived in Dadaab for the last 24 years, told Amnesty International: “They [the Kenyan authorities] are pushing us to Somalia. They came to our block areas with microphones and said: “You have to go register yourselves to go to Somalia… If you don’t go register yourself now you will have to go on foot with your babies on your backs.”
His testimony was echoed by Samira, who has lived in the camp for the last eight years. She said: “People believe after November the small return package won’t be there and there won’t be transport… People are moving before they miss the transport and money.”
No alternative options have been provided by Kenya or the international community for the majority of refugees not wishing to return to Somalia. Several of those who spoke to Amnesty International cited not only insecurity, but the lack of basic services and fear of discrimination as reasons for not wanting to return.

	
	
		Kenya’s increased restrictions on Somali refugees comes at a time of shocking failures by rich countries to accept their fair share of responsibility.
	

		
			Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes
		
Amongst those that expressed concerns about returning are people with disabilities and members of minority groups, returning to Somalia is not an option as no additional safeguards have been put in place for them.
Mouna, a mother of a disabled child, said: “There are no facilities for disabled people in Somalia. As refugees we are already considered last in everything. With children with disabilities we will be right at the back of the queue when it comes to receiving help.”
Amina, a woman whose six-year-old son is living with albinism said: “Another big part of the reason why I don't want to go back is that people don't understand albinism. Already some people here say he is illegitimate, he is a foreigner. He has been picked on by the other kids for being different. In Somalia I can see it being much worse. He also won't have access to the cream he gets for his skin.”
The lack of international support given to Kenya, including through consistently underfunding appeals and offering very limited resettlement places to vulnerable refugees, has contributed to the appalling situation in which the inhabitants of Dadaab currently find themselves. Just 10 countries host more than half of the world’s 21 million refugees – Kenya is one. 
“Kenya’s increased restrictions on Somali refugees comes at a time of shocking failures by rich countries to accept their fair share of responsibility. Rather than focusing on returning refugees to Somalia, where they are at risk of further human rights abuses, the international community should be working with Kenya to ensure long-term sustainable solutions,” said Michelle Kagari.  
“This includes increased resettlement places for the most vulnerable refugees. But it also includes Kenya guaranteeing refugees their rights and finding ways to integrate them into host communities and away from camps, with the full support of the international community.”
Background
The information provided by refugees interviewed was cross checked with governmental and non-governmental sources working both in Dadaab and on refugee policy. Researchers also reviewed the main body of existing research on the situation of refugees in Kenya, as well the relevant national laws and policy documents.
Kenya hosts more than 500,000 refugees. At least 330,000 of them are Somalis, of whom around 260,000 are in Dadaab refugee camp. Kenya has received limited support from the international community. As of 31 October 2016, UNHCR’s funding appeal for Kenya of US$272m was 38% funded. In 2015, a total of 5,001 individuals were resettled from Kenya, with more than 3,500 of those going to the USA. Only 671 vulnerable refugees were resettled in EU countries. So far in 2016 there have been 1,648 departures to the USA and 118 departures to the EU.
In recent years, a series of attacks by Al-Shabaab - including the 2013 attack on Nairobi’s Westgate Shopping Mall and the April 2015 attack on Garissa University College – as well as a perceived improvement in the security situation in Somalia, have resulted in mounting pressure by the Kenyan authorities to repatriate Somali refugees.
Somalia has been ravaged by over two decades of conflict. Fighting between government forces supported by African Union troops, and Al-Shabaab militants has resulted in gross human rights violations against civilians and devastated basic services and infrastructure.

		Hungary: Appalling treatment of asylum-seekers a deliberate populist ploy
	","
		Asylum-seekers – including unaccompanied children – are suffering violent abuse, illegal push backs and unlawful detention at the hands of Hungary’s authorities and a system blatantly designed to deter them, Amnesty International has revealed in a new report.
Stranded hope: Hungary’s sustained attack on the rights of refugees and migrants, published against the backdrop of the toxic referendum campaign on refugee quotas, finds hundreds of asylum-seekers are left waiting for months in degrading conditions. Many of those who manage to get into Hungary are pushed back to Serbia or detained unlawfully in detention centres.

	
	
		Appalling treatment and labyrinthine asylum procedures are a cynical ploy to deter asylum-seekers from Hungary’s ever more militarized borders
	

		
			John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International
		
“Prime minister Orbán has replaced the rule of law with the rule of fear. His attempts to deliberately prevent refugees and migrants from reaching Hungary have been accompanied by an ever more disturbing pattern of attacks on them and the international safeguards designed to protect them,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe.
“Appalling treatment and labyrinthine asylum procedures are a cynical ploy to deter asylum-seekers from Hungary’s ever more militarized borders. Against the backdrop of a toxic referendum campaign, poisonous anti-refugee rhetoric is reaching fever pitch.”
The report is based on research conducted in Serbia, Hungary and Austria and interviews with 143 people, the vast majority of whom were refugees and migrants. Their testimonies reveal shocking conditions facing those who attempt to enter and travel through Hungary, a country where irregular entries have been criminalised and the right to seek asylum is extremely restricted.
In September 2015 Hungary finished the construction of a vast fence along its border with Serbia (extended later to Croatia) and passed a law to fast track asylum claims. “Transit zones” - metal containers for processing claims and detaining admitted asylum-seekers – were opened at two border crossings. In total only 30 people are admitted to these zones to seek asylum each day leaving hundreds to languish in degrading conditions on the border or in overcrowded centres in Serbia. At the time of Amnesty International’s visit to the Hungarian-Serbian border, more than 600 people were staying in makeshift camps, many for months on end.
One asylum seeker at Horgoš camp whose elderly wife had to be carried for much of the journey from Afghanistan, told Amnesty International: “We’ve been here for 22 days and it’s not like we are crossing tomorrow.” Another asylum-seeker who had been at the same camp for 18 days said: “We run from war, we run from pain. So why do people at the border treat us like animals?”

With the formal process extremely restricted, some asylum seekers attempt to cross the border irregularly to Hungary. A law, passed in June 2016, allows immediate returns to Serbia of asylum seekers found up to 8km from the border fence in Hungarian territory. Those apprehended are unlawfully “pushed back” without any consideration of their needs for protection or particular vulnerabilities. Since this new law has been in place official statistics suggest the new push-back practice has largely replaced the formal criminal procedures for irregular entry.
Some of those interviewed told Amnesty International that excessive force was used during these push backs with asylum seekers being beaten, kicked and chased by dogs.
One asylum seeker witnessed police beating a man whom they picked up over the border. They were warned by a policeman: “We can do anything, if you complain no one will listen to you.”
An unaccompanied 17 year-old boy described how he was caught by police about 10km into Hungary. “One man in the group was kicked in the foot so his foot broke.”
Inside the transit zones, men travelling without family often find themselves detained unlawfully for periods of up to four weeks. Most of these men have their asylum applications declared inadmissible on the grounds that they came through Serbia, a “safe third country”. As Serbia does not formally take them back and does not provide access to a fair and individualized asylum process, those pushed back from the transit zones have little other option than to attempt a different route to the EU.
Asylum-seekers who pass through the “transit zones” successfully are taken to either closed or open asylum accommodation centres where conditions are dire. The centres lack basic services, barely provide education and activities for children or healthcare. Amnesty International also found evidence that some unaccompanied children are housed with adult men.
A lack of translators and a lengthy, complex asylum process create often insurmountable obstacles to asylum claims.

Detention is routine and at the time of the research, almost 60% of the twelve hundred registered asylum-seekers in Hungary were in asylum detention. One asylum-seeker from Afghanistan told Amnesty International: “When I came, I thought, Hungary is Europe, maybe it will be OK. But I realise that they hate us here.”
Despite repeated requests, Amnesty International was not allowed to visit Kiskunhalas asylum detention centre. However, the organization interviewed several former detainees who reported beatings and threats of violence by the police and security guards there. One Afghan asylum seeker told Amnesty International that he knew of around thirty people who were beaten during the four months he was held there. A Palestinian asylum seeker who was beaten in Kiskunhalas said: “The police and security guards know there are lots of cameras, so they push you away to a place where this can’t be seen.”
In December 2015, the scale of the suffering of refugees and asylum-seekers at Hungary’s borders and in-country and the country’s updated asylum legislation triggered the opening of an infringement procedure by the European Commission. These proceedings are yet to be concluded.

“Rather than being shamed by the exposure of Hungary’s flagrant breaches of international law, prime minister Orbán proudly extols them as an example for other countries to follow. Allowing this to go unchallenged will result in further misery for vulnerable people fleeing conflict,” said John Dalhuisen.
“European leaders need to get organized not ‘Orbánized’. Their failure to robustly challenge Hungary’s breaches of EU law will strengthen the hand of xenophobes and populists and could result in a serious structural threat to the rule of law and respect for human rights.”

		Refugee Crisis: ‘Leaders’ Summit’ fails to show leadership on refugees
	","
		The outcome of President Obama’s Leaders’ Summit on Refugees in New York marks a small step forward but falls far short of what is needed to address the global refugee crisis, said Amnesty International today.
Leaders at the summit increased commitments on resettlement, humanitarian funding, refugee education and access to work. The pledges – which pale in comparison to what is needed – come after the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants ended in abject failure earlier this week.
“This week’s summits only served to expose the leadership crisis. With few exceptions, many world leaders failed to rise to the occasion, making commitments that still leave millions of refugees staring into the abyss,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International.

 “Wealthy countries cannot only commit money and walk away. The 360,000 resettlement places offered globally need to be seen in the context of more than 20 million refugees worldwide, with half of them in just 10 countries. And those countries that are amongst the world’s worst abusers of refugee rights, such as Australia and EU states, cannot be allowed to tout small offers of help as a generous response to the crisis.” States attending the summit committed to increase funding by US$4.5 billion over 2015 levels. Ahead of the Summit the White House also announced that 51 US companies committed to donating, investing or raising more than US$650 million to aid the refugee crisis. This includes a US$500 million donation by investor and philanthropist George Soros. “It speaks volumes that one individual has pledged more than more than China, the world's most populous and second wealthiest country, which pledged US$300 million,” said Salil Shetty.

	
	
		While world leaders smile for the cameras, this week’s meagre summit outcomes do not let them off the hook. Until more countries, especially wealthy ones, take in a significantly greater and fairer share of the world’s refugees, they will remain on the wrong side of history.

 “The commitment to take some refugees in is a small step forward, but the absence of a desperately-needed global system for sharing responsibility after two major summits means states have missed a rare opportunity to take a giant leap towards solving the crisis.

		Australia: Official documents reveal serious incidents of abuse in Queensland juvenile detention centres
	","
		Australia must establish independent bodies to investigate child abuse in its detention facilities across the country, Amnesty International said today after it obtained more than 1,000 pages of government documents revealing abuses in two more centres. The documents -- obtained by Amnesty International through a Freedom of Information request – showed a number of serious incidents, including where staff at the centres in the state of Queensland put child detainees in solitary confinement, deployed a security dog where a child was threatening suicide, caused bone fractures as a result of restraint and control techniques, and conducted partial strip searches using humiliating methods.“These official documents shine a light in the darkest corners of these detention centres, and reveal incidents, and in some case policies, which may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in violation of Australia’s obligations under international law,” said Champa Patel, Amnesty International’s Senior Research Adviser for South East Asia and the Pacific.

The documents – which Amnesty International Australia obtained through a Freedom of Information request – describe incidents at the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre (CYDC) in Townsville, and the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre (BYDC) from 2010 to 2015. Indigenous Australians make up a majority of those held in the centres – accounting for 89% of children in the CYDC on an average day in 2015.In one incident at the CYDC in January 2013, a 17-year-old boy identified as being at high suicide risk was restrained by a group of staff members, who held him down on the floor, and put him in handcuffs and leg cuffs when he refused to return to his room.They then took the boy to a tiny isolation cell where they cut his clothing and underwear off with a knife. He was left naked in the cell for more than an hour before being given a gown to wear.The snapshot of the Queensland centres comes after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation exposed the mistreatment of six boys held in isolation at a detention centre in the Northern Territory city of Darwin.The boys there were teargassed and violently attacked at the Don Dale Detention Centre, including then-13-year-old Dylan Voller who was stripped naked and struck by guards. Harrowing images from years later in 2015 showed him at age 17 strapped to a restraint chair and hooded for hours, allegedly for being at risk of suicide.A Royal Commission into child protection and youth detention in the Northern Territory over the past decade was established after the case was brought to light.“Australia must put an end to these cruel, inhuman and degrading practices and stop sweeping these awful human rights violations under the rug. We have now seen hard evidence of these abuses happening in several states – it is clear what has been happening and this must be addressed urgently,” said Champa Patel.

Amnesty International calls on Australia to ensure any staff suspected of being involved in abuse should be suspended until independent investigations are completed. The Federal Government must also ensure independent oversight mechanisms are established in every State and Territory by immediately ratifying the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture.Other incidents outlined in the documents include:
Use of dogs. In 2014, a child on a roof threatened to self-harm or hang himself. A security guard and his dog were deployed to the scene, which was found to increase the young person’s anxiety. In August 2015, a guard allowed an un-muzzled dog to approach an Indigenous girl in an “aggressive manner” while she was attempting to get out of a pool. Amnesty International is pleased to note that this practice of using dogs has been subsequently discontinued as we have documented the use of dogs to instil fear into prisoners as a torture method used around the world. 
Solitary confinement. In March 2012 eight Indigenous children were held in isolation for 10 days in “near-continuous cell confinement” (approximately 22 hours a day). For the first two days of isolation, they were not allowed to leave their rooms at all.
Frequent attempts at self-harm or suicide, particularly at CYDC. According to the documents, 2015 saw 31 incidents of children in CYDC attempting suicide by “tying ligatures around their necks”. This number rose from 20 instances at CYDC in 2014. 
Unnecessary or excessive use of force. For example, in 2010 at CYDC there were four incidents when children suffered fractured wrists as a result of control and restraint techniques.
Partially clothed searches, during which children were asked to squat, with young girls asked to lift their breasts and young boys to lift their genitals prior to squatting - despite practices of squatting and lifting being prohibited in adult prisons.

		Australia/PNG: Closure of Manus Island detention only first step to ending offshore nightmare for refugees  
	","
		Responding to today’s reports that the Australian Government-run refugee detention centre on Manus Island will close Anna Neistat, Amnesty International’s Senior Director for Research, said:“While welcoming the news that the centre will close Amnesty International urges the Australian Government to bring those currently held there to Australia. We must not forget that the Government set up a system of deliberate abuse of and cruelty towards almost two thousand people in two detention centres who are simply looking for a safe place to rebuild their lives.”“Amnesty International calls on Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton to urgently confirm the timeframe by which it will close the detention centre and safely settle refugees in Australia. Offshore processing can no longer be part of Australia’s response to those attempting to arrive here by boat seeking protection.”

	
	
		The Australian Government must be held accountable for the many years of harm it has inflicted upon people seeking its protection, as well as shoulder its share of responsibility and treat people seeking asylum fairly.

Amnesty International recently investigated conditions in Nauru, and in November 2013 our team of investigators visited Manus Island. We found patterns of deliberate abuse at the hands of the Australian Government. These abuses are finally becoming known to other countries around the world.“It is high time the people currently trapped on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and on Nauru to be immediately brought to Australia to assess their refugee claims and live in the community. The Australian Government must be held accountable for the many years of harm it has inflicted upon people seeking its protection, as well as shoulder its share of responsibility and treat people seeking asylum fairly.”

		UN: Narrow national self-interest must not scupper Ban Ki-moon’s initiative to end refugee crisis
	","
		UN talks under way to agree a Global Compact on Refugees by 2018
Just one week left before game-changing proposal is locked in ahead of September Summit
A strong outcome would give fresh hope to 20 million refugees worldwide
States risk historic failure by sacrificing refugees’ rights for national self-interest
With just under a week to go, a group of unlikely bedfellows including Australia, China, Egypt, India, Russia, Pakistan and the UK, among others, risk bulldozing through the only worldwide effort under way to provide concrete action to deal with the global refugee crisis affecting 20 million people, warned Amnesty International today.
By the end of July, United Nations (UN) member states meeting in New York plan to finalize the text of an agreement towards a Global Compact on Refugees to tackle the current crisis and deal with similar emergencies in future. In the coming days, states have a final chance to change their positions before an outcome document is locked in for adoption at a UN Summit in September.“As time runs out to finalize what could and should be a game-changing agreement, so much hangs in the balance. Millions of refugees around the world are in desperate need – 86% live in low and middle-income countries often ill-equipped to host them, while many of the world’s wealthiest states host the fewest and do the least. This situation is inherently unfair,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.

	
	
		As time runs out to finalize what could and should be a game-changing agreement, so much hangs in the balance.

“With more than 150 heads of state and government due to gather at the UN in September to lay the foundations for a new global framework to address this refugee crisis, we should be on the cusp of a historic breakthrough. What looms instead is possibly a shameful historic failure, with some states sacrificing refugees’ rights for selfish national interests.
“But there is still time to step back from the precipice. Together with our millions of supporters around the world, Amnesty International will let our leaders know we won’t accept failure.”
Since November 2015, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been calling for a new approach to large movements of refugees and migrants. In May 2016 he set out some proposals in a report to the General Assembly, including for internationally agreed Compacts on refugees and migrants. A final plan will be signed off in the coming week before being adopted on 19 September, at the UN General Assembly’s first-ever high-level summit on refugees and migrants, billed as “a historic opportunity to come up with a blueprint for a better international response”.
A cornerstone of the new deal is global responsibility sharing – no country should have to take on more than its fair share and all states should recognize their common legally binding responsibilities to fulfill the human rights of people who have been forced to leave their homes due to war or persecution. But instead of responsibility sharing many states are continuing to indulge in short-sighted, and ultimately self-defeating, responsibility shifting.
Amnesty International has proposed a five-point plan for UN member states to share responsibility for hosting and assisting refugees equitably – according to their GDP, unemployment and other objective criteria.
However, governments appear to be on the cusp of rejecting the summit’s responsibility-sharing aims for a variety of reasons. Even the phrase “responsibility-sharing” is in jeopardy. And the Compact on refugees will now be deferred for two years because some states insist on giving it absolute parity with a Compact on migration.
All these excuses boil down to a lack of political will; a willingness to tolerate the entirely preventable suffering of millions of people, to keep building fences and to carry on with business as usual.
“The time for business as usual is over. With wealthy countries not doing nearly enough to host and assist refugees, the responsibility-sharing at the root of the Global Compact is an idea whose time has come. Rich and influential countries must stop making excuses and pull their weight,” said Salil Shetty.

	
	
		A concrete mechanism to share responsibility could save millions from misery and death by drowning or disease, offering refugees real, safe and legal escape routes from war and persecution.
	

		
			Salil Shetty
		
“The international community has come together in the past to respond to refugee crises and the UN has in recent times agreed solutions to equally wide-ranging global challenges. A concrete mechanism to share responsibility could save millions from misery and death by drowning or disease, offering refugees real, safe and legal escape routes from war and persecution.”
Background
The Political Declaration due to be agreed in September and the Global Compact on Refugee Responsibility Sharing which would follow in 2018 would not replace the existing protection framework enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention and its accompanying 1967 Protocol. Instead, they aim to build on these norms by creating a durable system for dealing with long-term refugee flows and periodic surges.
Amnesty International has long lobbied governments around the world to do more to share responsibility to fulfill refugees’ rights, and will be launching a groundbreaking global campaign on the refugee crisis in September.
The organization’s members and supporters worldwide will continue to lobby their governments to support fair and genuine responsibility-sharing that gives refugees a real chance at starting a new life in safety and dignity.

		Jordan: Response to border bombing must not include push-back of refugees
	","
		The “iron fist” security response pledged by Jordanian authorities in the wake of Tuesday’s car bombing of a military outpost along the border with Syria must not descend into closing the border and denying humanitarian aid to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing armed conflict, Amnesty International said today.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the apparently well-coordinated attack, which killed six army border guards and injured several others.
More than 70,000 people are stranded in the desert area known as “the berm”, which is a raised barrier of sand marking the Jordanian limit of the Jordan-Syria border near Rukban and Hadalat crossings. A total closure of the border and denial of humanitarian aid to the area would inevitably lead to extreme hardship among those unable to find refuge and put their lives at risk.
“Tens of thousands of refugees are trapped near where this attack took place. Many have fled some of the worst-affected areas of Syria including Aleppo, Deyr al-Zur, Homs, Hama and al-Raqqa. Their very lives continue to hang in the balance at the border,” said Sherif Elsayed-Ali Head of Refugee and Migrants’ Rights at Amnesty International.

“Jordan has a duty to protect civilians from armed attacks – but its security measures must not violate its international legal obligations to provide protection and assistance to refugees who are desperately fleeing the very same type of violence. Denying them entry into Jordan amounts to a violation of international law.”
The attack on Tuesday targeted the Rukban crossing in a remote desert area near where the borders of Jordan, Syria and Iraq meet. In mid-2014 Jordan effectively closed its eastern borders to Syrians fleeing the conflict which has led to a gradual build-up of people at its Rukban and Hadalat border crossings.
In November 2015 there were around 9,000 Syrians stranded with the numbers gradually increasing. Currently more than 60,000 people are staying in dire conditions near Rukban border crossing and more than 10,000 near Hadalat border crossing, hoping for permission to seek safety in Jordan.
In March 2016 Jordan reportedly agreed to admit up to 20,000 refugees stranded at the border crossings to Azraq refugee camp. However those admitted have been kept in a fenced area within the camp, known as ‘Village 5’. Humanitarian workers estimate that if the situation continues, there will be 100,000 Syrians stranded at the berm by the end of the year.
‘Iron fist’ response
The Jordanian authorities reacted swiftly to Tuesday’s attack – King Abdullah II said his government would respond with “an iron fist” and the border crossings were sealed.
“We are taking specific immediate steps. The first one is to close that … [border] crossing … and consider this area a closed military zone. We are also not building nor expanding any existing refugee camps,” Jordan's Information Minister, Mohammed Momani said in a statement to the media.
Jordan currently hosts more than 650,000 Syrian refugees registered by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the international community to increase support to Jordan as a main refugee hosting country including through fully funding the 2016 Jordan Response Plan and increasing the number of resettlement places offered. As of 12 June 2016, the Jordan Response Plan was 6.2% funded.

		UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) on the scene but denied access
Aceh authorities undermine Indonesian Vice President
Nine children and a heavily pregnant woman among 44 people at risk
The Indonesian authorities in Aceh are endangering the lives of a group of more than 40 Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers by firing warning shots and threatening to push them back out to sea in flagrant violation of international law, Amnesty International said today.
“Instead of deploying these crude intimidation tactics that could put the lives of men, women and children at risk, the Indonesian authorities should come together to allow them to disembark safely so the UN Refugee Agency can interview them,” said Josef Benedict, Amnesty International’s Director of Campaigns for South East Asia and the Pacific.

Today’s latest attempt to force the boat off the coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province and back out to sea comes a day after local Aceh police fired warning shots in the air, terrifying at least five Sri Lankan Tamil women who tried to run ashore. The group aboard the boat includes a heavily pregnant woman and nine children.
On Friday, a Banda Aceh immigration office spokesman said the Tamil asylum seekers who set out from Sri Lanka three weeks ago will not be allowed to disembark in Indonesia. Their original intended destination was Australia’s Christmas Island.
Aceh police chief Inspector Gen. Husein Hamidi said that after providing food to the group of Sri Lankan Tamils and repairing their boat, the policy and navy were preparing to push them back into international waters.
“Indonesia risks squandering the good will it generated when it provided assistance last year to hundreds of refugees and migrants who had been stranded on the Andaman Sea. In contrast to what happened in May 2015, developments this week invite comparisons with other countries that have a notorious record of setting desperate people adrift and at risk of death on the high seas,” said Josef Benedict.
The immigration office, police and navy in Aceh have ignored Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla’s directions to provide the group with shelter. Instead, they have blocked off the area, denying the Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers access to the shore.
UNHCR officials are on standby in Aceh province, ready to interview the group of Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers to verify their identities and determine their status.
“The immigration office and security forces in Aceh are flouting the authority of their own Vice President and not letting the UNHCR do its job. Consistent standards must be applied across the board, with all Indonesian authorities working together with recognized international bodies,” said Josef Benedict.

Aceh fishermen discovered the boat off the coast of Aceh province on 11 June. They subsequently reported the boat to the Indonesian Navy who have not allowed the people on the boat to disembark and apply for asylum, arguing the asylum-seekers lack the proper documentation. Under international law, neither a lack of documentation nor irregular entry precludes people from seeking asylum.
The boat began a hazardous journey from India after those on board reportedly fled Sri Lanka, where the members of the Tamil minority have suffered past persecution. Despite many recent improvements, there are still concerns about discriminatory practices against Tamils by law enforcement officials.The group had set out from India, more than 1,700 km away, on a boat bearing an Indian flag. They had been travelling for more than three weeks headed for Australia. As they neared the coast of Aceh, bad weather struck, stranding their boat off Lhoknga.The UN Human Rights Council noted in April that Sri Lanka saw a spate of arrests of Tamils under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Arrests carried out under the PTA have, in a number of cases, failed to meet the minimum standards of due process laid out in directives by Sri Lanka’s National Human Rights Commission. Sri Lankan Tamils remain deeply concerned about what they say is a persistent culture of surveillance in the north and east of the country.

		EU’s reckless refugee returns to Turkey illegal
	","
		The European Union (EU) must immediately halt plans to return asylum-seekers to Turkey on the false pretence that it is a “safe country” for refugees, said Amnesty International in a briefing published today.
The briefing, No safe refuge: Asylum-seekers and refugees denied effective protection in Turkey, details the short-comings in Turkey’s asylum system and the hardships refugees face there that would render their return under the EU-Turkey Agreement of 18 March illegal – and unconscionable.
The briefing shows that Turkey’s asylum system is struggling to cope with more than three million asylum-seekers and refugees. As a result, asylum-seekers face years waiting for their cases to be dealt with, during which time they receive little or no support to find shelter and sustenance for themselves and their families, with children as young as nine working to support families.

	
	
		The EU-Turkey deal is reckless and illegal.
	

		
			John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia.
		
“The EU-Turkey deal is reckless and illegal. Amnesty International’s findings expose as a fiction the idea that Turkey is able to respect the rights and meet the needs of over three million asylum-seekers and refugees,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia.
“In its relentless efforts to prevent irregular arrivals to Europe, the EU has wilfully misrepresented what is actually happening on the ground in Turkey. It is to be expected that a new asylum system, in a country hosting the largest number of refugees in the world, would struggle. While there is value in supporting and encouraging Turkey to develop a fully functioning asylum system, the EU cannot act as if it already exists.”
Turkey failing to protect refugees
Despite its broadly welcoming attitude towards refugees, the large numbers of people – about 2.75 million Syrian refugees and 400,000 asylum-seekers and refugees from other countries (primarily Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran) – have inevitably placed a considerable strain both on Turkey’s new asylum system and its capacity to meet people’s basic needs.
The report shows how the Turkish asylum system fails three crucial tests required under international law for the return of asylum seekers to Turkey to be lawful: status, durable solutions and subsistence.
1. Status
Turkey lacks the capacity to process asylum applications, meaning that hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers and refugees languish in legal limbo for years at a time. The Turkish authorities have refused to provide Amnesty International with asylum statistics. In April, however, they reported having processed around 4,000 applications, or 1.5% of the 266,000 applications registered with the UN Refugee Agency, in 2015.
2. Durable Solutions
Refugees should either be integrated in the country, resettled to another country or, if safe, repatriated to their country of origin. However, Turkey denies full refugee status, and with it integration, to all non-European refugees, while the international community is failing to provide anywhere close to sufficient resettlement options/places. This leaves refugees in a double-bind, where they cannot build a new life in Turkey but they have little hope of being offered the option to resettle to another country in the coming years, if at all.
Faiza, (whose name has been changed) and her sister, both Afghans, fled forced marriages in Iran and were recognized as refugees in Turkey. For three years, they waited in vain for an interview at a resettlement country’s embassy. In the end they did not see any option but to risk their lives in a smuggler’s boat to Greece.
Faiza told Amnesty International that had there been any reasonable prospect of leaving Turkey safely and regularly, and some support while waiting for the process to conclude, she and her sister would have waited. She explained: “If there was any hope of resettlement, we would have waited. We were really scared of the journey to Europe because we knew it was dangerous. But…we were so desperate. We said to ourselves: ‘Maybe we will die, maybe we won’t arrive – but it doesn’t matter because we can’t stay in Turkey anymore.’”

	
	
		Maybe we will die, maybe we won’t arrive – but it doesn’t matter because we can’t stay in Turkey anymore.

3. Subsistence 
The vast majority of Syrian and other refugees are forced to seek shelter without government support. Although the Turkish authorities are accommodating more than 264,000 Syrian refugees in camps in the southern border provinces, they cannot realistically provide shelter for the remaining 90% (2.48 million) from Syria. Meanwhile, it has only made social housing available for 100 of the 400,000 (0.025%) asylum-seekers and refugees from other countries. This means that approximately three million asylum-seekers and refugees are being left to meet their own shelter needs as best they can.
Amnesty International researchers interviewed 57 refugees in Turkey between March and May 2016. All described the struggle to survive with almost no financial support from the authorities, with the vast majority relying on charity from family members, fellow asylum-seekers, or religious communities.
Refugees told Amnesty International how they live in shoddy or make-shift accommodation, sometimes sleeping in mosques, parks and metro stations because they cannot afford the rent. Two Afghan families were sleeping under a bridge in Istanbul after three of their children drowned in a failed sea-crossing.
“Turkey has been a generous host of refugees, but its promises to EU leaders are simply not reflected in the situation on the ground. Asylum seekers and refugees are stuck for years in Turkey and, while they’re waiting, are given neither support nor the right to support themselves,” said John Dalhuisen.

	
	
		This is a reality check for Europe’s leaders.

“This is a reality check for Europe’s leaders. It may be politically expedient to outsource their legal duty to help people fleeing conflict, but if they think they can do this either lawfully or without inflicting additional misery on people already fleeing terrible suffering, they are tragically and quite obviously mistaken.”
Child refugees working to make ends meet
The briefing also warns that child labour is common among refugees in Turkey as families struggle to meet basic needs.
A Syrian mother of three boys told Amnesty International that her entire family of seven survives on the 5-10 Turkish Lira a day (about US$1.75 to $3.50) that her nine-year old son earns working at a grocery store. The shrapnel injuries her husband sustained in Syria prevent him from working.
EU must share, not outsource, responsibilityRather than off-loading its responsibilities on Turkey, the EU should be looking to kick-start an ambitious resettlement programme for refugees currently in the country.
While Turkey hosts more than three million asylum-seekers and refugees, more than any other country in the world, EU member states collectively resettled only 8,155 refugees from around the world in 2015.
“The European Union has responded to one of the darkest humanitarian catastrophes of our time by putting up fences, deploying more border guards, and striking dodgy deals with neighbouring countries to keep people out. The result is misery and suffering, and more deaths at sea,” said John Dalhuisen.
Background: EU-Turkey deal already undermined by forcible returns from Turkey to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria
On 18 March 2016, the EU and Turkey agreed to a far-reaching migration control deal - formally a statement. In exchange for up to €6 billion as well as political concessions from the EU, Turkey agreed to take back all “irregular migrants” who cross into the Greek islands after 20 March.
The justification for the EU-Turkey deal is the assumption that Turkey is a safe place to which asylum-seekers and refugees can be returned. Beyond not respecting refugee rights within Turkey (the subject of this report), another way in which a country might not be “safe” is if it sends people to other countries where they face a risk of serious human rights violations. Previous Amnesty International research has already shown that in late 2015 and early 2016, asylum-seekers and refugees in Turkey were sent back to precisely such a risk in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

		EU-Turkey deal: Greek decision highlights fundamental flaws
	","
		A Syrian national who arrived on the Greek island of Lesvos has won an appeal against a decision that would have led to his forcible return to Turkey, underscoring the fundamental flaws in the migration deal agreed in March between the European Union and Turkey, Amnesty International said.
In the first such decision Amnesty International has seen since the deal, an appeals committee in Athens overturned an initial decision considering Turkey a safe third country on the grounds that Turkey does not afford refugees the full protection required under the Refugee Convention. The committee also ruled that Turkey does not guarantee the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids returning someone to a country where he or she is at risk of serious human rights violations.
“This decision goes to the heart of why the EU-Turkey deal was so deeply flawed to begin with,” said Gauri van Gulik, Deputy Europe Director at Amnesty International.

	
	
		“This decision goes to the heart of why the EU-Turkey deal was so deeply flawed to begin with. Turkey is not safe for refugees.

“Turkey is not safe for refugees, it does not offer them full protection, and assurances on paper are simply not good enough. We’ve seen the reality on the ground: until Turkey ends all violations against refugees and guarantees them full protection, nobody else should be sent back under this deal. Instead Europe should focus on its part of the deal by accepting refugees for resettlement from Turkey. It should also urgently improve conditions for refugees in Greece.”
The Syrian national applied for asylum after the EU-Turkey deal came into force. While the committee’s decision can be appealed, it removes the imminent risk of him being forcibly returned to Turkey. A Greek official confirmed to Amnesty International that about 100 cases are still pending before the appeals committee.
Amnesty International has previously documented how Turkish authorities have been violating international law, for instance by forcibly returning groups of Afghan and Syrian refugees since the EU-Turkey deal was struck. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have published accounts of Syrian asylum-seekers being beaten and shot at by Turkish security forces.
Amnesty International has also documented dire conditions on the Greek islands where more than 8,500 people are currently stranded while they wait to apply for asylum or receive news of their applications.

		Kenya: Reckless closure of world’s biggest refugee camp will put lives at risk
	","
		The Kenyan government’s decision to close down two large refugee camps, including the world’s biggest at Dadaab, is likely to put thousands of innocent lives at risk, said Amnesty International today.
“This reckless decision by the Kenyan government is an abdication of its duty to protect the vulnerable and will put thousands of lives at risk,” said Muthoni Wanyeki, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“It could lead to the involuntary return of thousands of refugees to Somalia and other countries of origin, where their lives may still be in danger. This would be in violation of Kenya’s obligations under international law.”
In a statement, the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government, Dr Karanja Kibicho, said the decision to close Dadaab and Kakuma camps was due to “immense security challenges such as the threat of Al-Shabaab.”
He said Kenya had hosted more than 600,000 refugees for over a quarter of a century and had shouldered a “very heavy economic, security and environmental burden.”
He also asked for the support of the international community to expedite the process.
“While it is true that resettlement to third countries has been slow, Kenya should itself consider permanent solutions towards the full integration of refugees, some of whose stay in Kenya is now over generations,” said Muthoni Wanyeki. “Forced return to situations of persecution or conflict is not an option.”

		Turkey: Illegal mass returns of Syrian refugees expose fatal flaws in EU-Turkey deal 
	","
		Large-scale forced returns of refugees from Turkey to war-ravaged Syria expose the fatal flaws in a refugee deal signed between Turkey and the European Union earlier this month, Amnesty International revealed today.
New research carried out by the organization in Turkey’s southern border provinces suggests that Turkish authorities have been rounding up and expelling groups of around 100 Syrian men, women and children to Syria on a near-daily basis since mid-January. Over three days last week, Amnesty International researchers gathered multiple testimonies of large-scale returns from Hatay province, confirming a practice that is an open secret in the region.
All forced returns to Syria are illegal under Turkish, EU and international law.
“In their desperation to seal their borders, EU leaders have wilfully ignored the simplest of facts: Turkey is not a safe country for Syrian refugees and is getting less safe by the day,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia.
“The large-scale returns of Syrian refugees we have documented highlight the fatal flaws in the EU-Turkey deal. It is a deal that can only be implemented with the hardest of hearts and a blithe disregard for international law.”

	
	
		Far from pressuring Turkey to improve the protection it offers Syrian refugees, the EU is in fact incentivizing the opposite.
	

		
			Amnesty International's John Dalhuisen
		
The EU-Turkey deal paves the way for the immediate return to Turkey of Syrian refugees arriving on the Greek islands, on the grounds that it is safe country of asylum. EU officials have expressed the hope that returns could start as of Monday 4 April.
The EU’s extended courting of Turkey that preceded the deal has already had disastrous knock-on effects on Turkey’s own policies towards Syrian refugees.
“Far from pressuring Turkey to improve the protection it offers Syrian refugees, the EU is in fact incentivizing the opposite,” said John Dalhuisen.
“It seems highly likely that Turkey has returned several thousand refugees to Syria in the last seven to nine weeks. If the agreement proceeds as planned, there is a very real risk that some of those the EU sends back to Turkey will suffer the same fate.”
Children and a pregnant woman among those returned
One of the cases uncovered by Amnesty International is of three young children forced back into Syria without their parents; another is of the forced return of an eight-month pregnant woman.
“The inhumanity and scale of the returns is truly shocking; Turkey should stop them immediately,” said John Dalhuisen.
Many of those returned to Syria appear to be unregistered refugees, though Amnesty International has also documented cases of registered Syrians being returned, when apprehended without their papers on them.
Syrian refugees denied registration
Amnesty International’s recent research also shows that the Turkish authorities have scaled back the registration of Syrian refugees in the southern border provinces.
Registration is required to access basic services. In Gaziantep, Amnesty International met with the son of a woman requiring emergency surgery to save her life but who was denied the ability to register – and therefore have the surgery. She eventually was able to register elsewhere and receive the life-saving treatment.

	
	
		Having witnessed the creation of Fortress Europe, we are now seeing the copy-cat construction of Fortress Turkey.
	

		
			Amnesty International's John Dalhuisen
		
According to other Syrian refugees in the border province of Hatay, some people attempting to register have been detained and forced back into Syria, together with refugees found without their registration documents.
Amnesty International spoke to a family of unregistered Syrian refugees in Hatay province who have opted to remain in their apartment rather than trying to register, for fear they will be returned to Syria.
There are currently around 200,000 displaced people within 20km of Turkey’s border. According to humanitarian aid groups as well as camp residents, conditions in camps close to the border are abysmal, without clean water or sanitation. A camp resident reported kidnappings for ransom among the dangers.
Tighter border restrictions
Increased border security and the lack of any regular means of crossing have pushed people into the hands of smugglers, who are demanding at least US$1,000 per person to take people into Turkey, according to Syrian nationals Amnesty International spoke to on both sides of the border.
The increasingly restrictive border policies are a radical change from those adopted previously by the Turkish authorities during the five years of the Syrian crisis. Previously, Syrian residents with passports had been able to cross at regular border gates, and those who entered irregularly – the vast majority – were also able to register with the Turkish authorities.
“Over the last few months, Turkey has introduced visa requirements for Syrians arriving by air, sealed its land border with Syria for all but those in need of emergency medical care, and shot at some of those attempting to cross it irregularly,” said John Dalhuisen.
“Now Turkey is touting the creation of an undeliverable safe zone inside Syria. It is clear where this is all heading: having witnessed the creation of Fortress Europe, we are now seeing the copy-cat construction of Fortress Turkey.”
 
TESTIMONIES
A Syrian family whose children were forcibly returned to Syria
An extended family of 24 people lived together in a single apartment in Antakya, Hatay province. They told Amnesty International that five members of their family were forcibly returned to Syria on or around 20 February 2016.
Thirty-year-old M.Z., in Turkey since early 2015, had been able to register. His 20-year-old brother, M.A., and their 11 year-old nephew and two nieces, aged 10 and nine, had arrived in Turkey around two months previously and had not been able to register because they had been told that it was impossible, and that those who tried risked being sent back to Syria.
The two brothers were taking their nephew and nieces to the park to play when they were stopped by police, who demanded their identification papers. The police took all five Syrian refugees to a nearby police station.
Z.Z. – another of M.Z.’s brothers who lived with them in Antakya – told Amnesty International that after learning of their detention, he brought M.Z.’s registration card to the police station, but that the police refused to release any of them.
M.Z. told Amnesty International by phone from Syria that after being detained for a few hours, all five refugees were put on a bus and driven to the Cilvegözü / Bab al-Hawa border crossing in Hatay province.
They were not alone. M.Z. said that there were a total of seven buses, with about 30 people on each bus – mostly families – representing up to 210 Syrian refugees. Two police cars accompanied the buses, and M.Z. told Amnesty International that on his bus there was a Turkish soldier armed with an assault rifle.
M.Z.’s brother followed the buses to Bab al-Hawa but said he was not permitted to speak to his relatives. When they reached the border at about 3am, they were handed over to the Ahrar al Sham armed group. On the Syrian side, M.Z. told a soldier that he had no money to care for the three children. The soldier then drove them to Atma refugee camp, in Syria’s Idlib province.
M.Z. does not know what happened to the other people on the buses. He describes conditions in the Atma camp as atrocious, with no running water or sanitation facilities and completely inadequate food supplies.
M.Z. said that the children have developed skin conditions and that since being in Atma his nephew has developed vision problems.
The five Syrians are still able to communicate with their family in Antakya by phone. The children’s mother told Amnesty International, “They are crying all the time; when they talk I can’t even understand what they are saying.”
Aid groups reported in December 2015 that nearly 58,000 people were living in Atma camp. M.Z. told Amnesty International that he has tried to return to Turkey several times over the past month.
M.Z.’s family in Antakya told Amnesty International that smugglers would charge them about US$1,000 per person to cross, but M.Z. says he only has around 500 Syrian pounds (just over US$2).
Most of the remaining members of the family, including children, are unregistered and remain in their Antakya apartment for fear that they too could be returned to Syria. They rely on registered members of the family to bring supplies to the house.
Two men whose brother and his pregnant wife were returned to Syria
The two brothers said that around 3 March 2016, they were travelling in two cars with their brother and his wife, having crossed the Turkey-Syria border near Yayladağı in Hatay province the same day. About 3km into Turkish territory, Turkish border guards stopped the car in which their brother K.A. and his wife B.Q. were travelling. K.A. phoned his two brothers in the other car to tell them what had happened.
The two men explained to Amnesty International that their brother and sister-in-law were sent back to Syria in a van to the Cilvegözü / Bab al-Hawa border crossing in Hatay province, along with seven other vans carrying Syrian refugees. Each van allegedly transported around 14 people, which represents around 112 Syrian refugees. The brother and his now nine-month pregnant wife are living in Atma camp across from the Turkish border.
A man whose mother required emergency life-saving surgery
A Syrian man said his mother had not been permitted to register in Gaziantep, despite urgently requiring life-saving surgery that could only be accessed with registration.
A doctor had told him that every day that passed without the surgery would endanger his mother’s life. After two weeks of trying to register in Gaziantep, showing numerous medical test results as proof of the urgency of the situation, they gave up and instead convinced the authorities to register her in Kilis, some 60km away. The mother was subsequently able to receive the free medical care she required.
A Syrian man in Azaz who was unlawfully pushed back from the border
The man had been part of a group of around 60 people trying to cross irregularly to Turkey on 20 February 2016. He said that they were apprehended by Turkish border guards and detained in a military barracks near Reyhanlı in Hatay province.
He told Amnesty International he was detained for four hours, and that other people in the barracks (including women and children) were detained for up to 24 hours. He said that the border guards did not provide any food or water, nor access to toilets.

		Around 30 Afghan asylum-seekers detained, denied access to asylum procedures and forcibly returned to Afghanistan despite fearing Taliban attacks
Follows pattern of forcible returns and other abuses against Syrian and other nationals, documented by Amnesty International in December 2015
Returnees being held in notorious EU-funded centre in Turkey
 Turkey’s forcible return of around 30 Afghan asylum seekers just hours after the European Union (EU)-Turkey refugee deal came into force shows that implementing the deal would risk refugees’ lives from the word go, Amnesty International said.
The organization has received credible information indicating that Turkey violated European and international law by forcibly returning the asylum-seekers, who fear attacks by the Taliban, to Kabul without granting them access to an asylum procedure.

 “The ink wasn’t even dry on the EU-Turkey deal when several dozen Afghans were forced back to a country where their lives could be in danger. This latest episode highlights the risks of returning asylum seekers to Turkey – and the knock-on effects the deal is likely to have for refugees transiting through Turkey. It’s like watching a train wreck in slow motion,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia. At 23:40pm on Friday 18 March, a few hours after EU and Turkish leaders signed the deal in Brussels, Amnesty International received a panicked call from an Afghan asylum-seeker, “H.R.” [initials changed for security reasons]. He said he was on a plane in Istanbul, and then called again around an hour later during the flight’s layover in Ankara. He said he was being forcibly returned to Kabul along with around 30 other Afghan women, men and children, after their requests to apply for asylum in Turkey were refused.

They were apprehended by the Turkish coastguard and then detained in the western coastal city of İzmir. 
After five days in detention, he said he was physically forced to put his thumbprint on a document “agreeing” to a voluntary return to Afghanistan. He was not given a copy of the document. H.R. told Amnesty International by phone:  “We don’t want to go back because we are in danger in Afghanistan. If we go back, we will be killed by the Taliban.”  The flight from Ankara to Kabul left at 1:30am on Saturday 19 March. Amnesty International has seen a photo of H.R.’s boarding pass, as well as a travel document issued by the Afghan authorities in Turkey, apparently showing that he was “deported because of illegal entry [to Turkey]”.  Although H.R. responded to messages mid-day on Sunday in Kabul, subsequent attempts to reach him have failed and his phone appears to have been switched off.

			""H.R."", an asylum seeker from Afghanistan
		
 When contacted by Amnesty International about the returns, the Turkish Directorate General of Migration Management acknowledged the return of 27 Afghans, but insisted that all were returned voluntarily and that none had requested asylum.  The events described by H.R. are identical to forced returns and other abuses documented by Amnesty International in a December 2015 report. The organization found that refugees and asylum-seekers were apprehended at the western border, detained without access to lawyers, and then forcibly returned to Syria and Iraq after being forced to sign “voluntary return” papers. At the time the European Commission responded that it would keep this “serious matter under review”, however it is still not acknowledging the violations as documented by Amnesty International. In recent months, growing numbers of refugees intercepted en route to Greece have been transferred to the EU-funded Erzurum Removals Centre, from which they have been forcibly returned to their countries of origin without access to lawyers and asylum proceedings. Without any human rights benchmarks or independent monitoring of the EU-Turkey deal’s implementation, there is no guarantee that such abuses will not be repeated.  “Returns to Turkey cannot proceed on the basis that Turkey is a safe country for refugees. The EU should adopt an independent resettlement plan and work with its partner Turkey to end the abuse of refugee rights,” said John Dalhuisen

Background
While Turkish law protects the right of asylum seekers to apply for asylum from detention, Amnesty International has documented many cases where this right has not been granted in practice. Asylum applications for people who remain within Turkey are rarely processed in practice. Amnesty International has repeatedly made freedom of information requests regarding the number of claims processed by the Turkish authorities and the number of people provided with refugee status. The authorities have repeatedly refused to provide this information on the grounds that it is “confidential”.

The authorities need to look at this situation holistically: not just out of concern for border-management, housing and hygiene. Each of these individuals has needs and rights that must be protected.
“The French authorities must ensure those evicted are meaningfully consulted and that all their options are considered. This includes facilitating access to asylum proceedings in France and visas to the UK for those with family members there, or other good grounds for admission.

		Russia: ‘Shameful’ plan to deport Syrian refugees back to warzone violates international law

		Russia is violating international law by trying to deport three Syrian refugees who were detained in Dagestan after seeking asylum in the country, Amnesty International has said.
The three men are due to be flown to Damascus on Thursday despite the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) asking Russia not to deport them to a country at war.
“The Russian authorities are pretending it is safe for people to go back to the country where Russia itself is a warring party and is unforgivably ignoring the country’s refugee crisis,” said Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia.
“The attempt to deport these three men - in violation of international human rights and refugee law - is the latest example exposing Russia’s shameful approach to people in need of international protection.”
In 2015, not a single person from Syria was given refugee status in Russia, while temporary asylum was given to only 482 people.

The three Syrian men, Zakari Barri Abdalmuzma, Drubi Khaisam and Wafan Sadakh Edlin, were taken to Moscow from a temporary detention centre for foreigners in Makhachkala, Dagestan on Wednesday.
UNHCR has called for the deportations to be halted, while the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has also intervened and ordered the Russian authorities not to deport Abdalmuzma.
“Not only is Russia’s Ministry of Defence falsely denying that civilians are being killed in its aerial bombardment of Syria, it is also knowingly sending refugees back to a country where they are at real risk of serious human rights violations,” said Denis Krivosheev.
“The Russian authorities must stop this deportation and instead fulfil their international obligation to protect refugees by offering asylum to these three men, along with other refugees from Syria.”
Two other Syrians are held in the detention centre for foreigners in Makhachkala. One of them, Kuro Sabri from Aleppo, has seen his requests for asylum systematically rejected since he was detained a year ago today.
Sabri has been living in Russia since 2011 and has a Russian wife and child, but this has had no impact on the stance of the Russian authorities. Until now, only the intervention of the ECtHR has prevented his return to Syria.
The Russian Migration Service has also attempted to deny asylum to another refugee, Shava Mohamed from Aleppo, in defiance of a Russian court ruling. The Migration Service claimed that there is no fighting in the city and that only Kurds, Armenians or Circassians are in need of protection.
Amnesty International has documented heavy fighting in Aleppo that has displaced tens of thousands of people in February alone.

	","
		A new plan to tackle unprecedented refugee flows to Europe, mooted by the Dutch Presidency of the European Union today, is fundamentally flawed since it would hinge on illegally returning asylum seekers and refugees from Greece to Turkey, Amnesty International warned.
Plans to label Turkey a “safe third country” in order to ferry back tens of thousands of people from Greece without due process or access to asylum application procedures would blatantly violate both European and international law.
“No one should be fooled by the humanitarian sheen of this fundamentally flawed proposal. It is political expediency, plain and simple, aimed at stopping the flows of desperate people across the Aegean Sea,” said John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia Director at Amnesty International.

			John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia Director at Amnesty International
		
“Any resettlement proposal that is conditional on effectively sealing off borders and illegally pushing back tens of thousands of people while denying them access to asylum procedures is morally bankrupt. The pan-European response to the global refugee crisis has long been in disarray, so solutions are needed, and fast. But there is no excuse for breaking the law and flouting international obligations in the process.”
Under international law, vulnerable people fleeing conflict and persecution must not be denied access to protection and have a right to have their asylum claims considered. If the plan goes ahead, as soon as this spring, EU countries would begin considering Turkey a “safe third country”, a designation which would lead to them pushing back all asylum-seekers intercepted on the sea crossing to Greece. Amnesty International warned these would amount to illegal push-backs under international law.
In return for Turkey accepting those who are pushed back, a core group of EU countries would voluntarily resettle between 150,000 and 250,000 refugees currently hosted in Turkey.
There are serious concerns about the situation of refugees and asylum-seekers in Turkey. The country hosts an estimated 2.5 million Syrian refugees and 250,000 refugees and asylum-seekers from other countries including Afghanistan and Iraq. Asylum applications for non-Syrians are rarely processed in practice.
In addition, Amnesty International has documented how, since September 2015, in parallel with EU-Turkey migration talks, the Turkish authorities have unlawfully rounded up scores – possibly hundreds – of refugees and asylum-seekers. They have been herded onto buses and transported more than 1,000 kilometres to isolated detention centres where they have been held incommunicado. Some report being shackled for days on end, beaten and forcibly transported back to the countries they had fled.
“Turkey cannot possibly be considered a safe country for refugees. It is not even a safe country for many of its own citizens. In recent months refugees have been illegally returned to Iraq and Syria, while refugees from other countries face years in limbo before their applications will ever be heard,” said John Dalhuisen.

	
	
		A large-scale resettlement scheme for refugees from Turkey to the EU is a good idea, but making it conditional on the swift return of those crossing the border irregularly is tantamount to bartering in human lives.

Offering safe, legal routes to Europe is the only sustainable solution for the refugee situation.”While the full plan has yet to be made public, the Dutch social-democrat leader Diederik Samsom revealed some details in an exclusive interview today with the national newspaper De Volkskrant.

		Refugee Crisis: Balkans border blocks leave thousands stranded
	","
		New border control rules implemented almost simultaneously by the governments of Macedonia, Serbia and Croatia over the past 48 hours have resulted in large-scale renewed human rights violations, including collective expulsions and discrimination against individuals perceived to be economic migrants or refugees on the basis of their nationality, Amnesty International said today. The organization has monitored how the new measures in place along this route since 18 November have denied many people access to asylum procedures and left thousands of people stranded in dire conditions at Greece’s border crossing with Macedonia.
“This extremely worrying chain of events has yet again left thousands of people stranded in limbo, purely because of where they are from. At the very time when governments in the Balkans and Europe have vowed to work more closely together to improve safety and access to asylum on the Balkans route, the opposite is happening,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia.

	
	
		These governments appear to have acted without thinking through the consequences for thousands of people who are now stranded in grossly inadequate conditions with nowhere to go and precious little humanitarian assistance. With thousands more people on the way, action is urgently needed to reverse this worsening disaster.

“These governments appear to have acted without thinking through the consequences for thousands of people who are now stranded in grossly inadequate conditions with nowhere to go and precious little humanitarian assistance. This will only push those who are stranded back into the hands of smugglers. With thousands more people on the way, action is urgently needed to reverse this worsening disaster.”
Push-backs and segregation
During the night of 18 November, Macedonia, Serbia and Croatia all changed their border management practices suddenly, without prior notice, and more or less simultaneously. Macedonia was the first to act, by refusing to admit anyone unless they have papers to prove they originate from Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria. This meant that hundreds of people were stranded, either because they are from other countries, including Iran, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan, or because they do not have identity papers. Greek border police in the village of Idomeni continue to prevent nationals of countries other than Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria from leaving on the basis that Macedonia would not let them in.
At 11am yesterday the Macedonian authorities suddenly closed the border to all nationalities, and kept it shut overnight. The border opened again this morning, but only for Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi nationals who are crossing at a rate of only around 50 per hour. There is a heavy Macedonian police presence at the border.
According to staff from the humanitarian NGO Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) who are on the ground, around 6,000 people slept rough at Idomeni last night – up from 1,500 the previous night. The arrival of thousands more this evening is expected to swell the crowd to around 8,000 people staying in Idomeni tonight, according to MSF. There is shelter for only 900 people there. The reception centre in Gevgelija, on the Macedonian side of the border, lies empty and unused. Local solidarity groups and an NGO have been providing food in Idomeni while UNHCR and Save the Children are managing meal distribution. Around a dozen UNHCR staff are currently present and plan to increase their resources.
While the Greek authorities have sent police reinforcements Amnesty International noted that they continue to fail to support humanitarian needs.
Tensions among nationalities have also been evident. On 19 November a group of around 200 Iranian nationals protested along the railway tracks, blocking the exit of a train carrying Syrian nationals to Macedonia.
Simultaneous border blocks
On the night of 18 November, Serbian border officials also started screening incoming individuals by nationality, allowing people of only Afghan, Iraqi or Syrian origin through. Around 200 people were collectively expelled back to Macedonia, where they spent the night at Tabanovce train station in prefabricated pods provided by UNHCR.
The next night, Macedonia closed its border with Serbia, leaving around 100 people stuck in the no-man’s land between the two countries’ border control posts. UNHCR was not allowed access to them, although the Red Cross was able to provide blankets. These people have now been returned to Macedonia and have been provided shelter in Tabanovce train station.
Also on 18 November, around 440 people were blocked from entering Croatia at its border with Serbia, with border police from both countries working together to prevent people getting on trains at Sid. A group – consisting mainly of single males, but also including three women and two children, from countries including Morocco, Bangladesh and Pakistan – was apprehended in Croatia and bussed back to Serbia.
Stiffer EU border controls
The ramped-up border controls along the Balkans route came ahead of today’s extraordinary meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Brussels – the first in the wake of the attacks on Paris on 13 November. The agenda included a discussion about increasing security controls along the EU’s external borders as well as within the nominally borderless Schengen zone, but there seemed to be no focus on protecting human rights.

“It is crucial for countries in the region, in tandem with the EU and all its member states, to effectively coordinate border control without discrimination, which results in collective expulsions and unlawful returns of refugees and asylum seekers. Managed, safe and legal routes into Europe, with access to effective asylum procedures for all who wish to apply would go a long way towards identifying security threats, while also living up to international obligations to provide protection to people who need it,” said John Dalhuisen.
Background
In July 2015, Amnesty International released a report, Europe’s borderlands: Violations against migrants and refugees in Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, documenting how refugees and migrants were routinely subjected to unlawful push-backs and ill-treatment by border police, and at risk of exploitation by smugglers.
The situation has only worsened as the flows of people increased throughout the summer and autumn months, and reached a crisis point on 15 September, when Hungary effectively sealed off its border entirely, placing additional stress on an already ad hoc and poorly coordinated migration route through the Balkans.

		Refugees endangered and dying due to EU reliance on fences and gatekeepers
	","
		Note: This text has been modified following the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015.
In the wake of last Friday’s atrocious attacks on Paris the European Union (EU) must resist the urge to further seal off its external borders, which would continue to fuel a range of human rights abuses while doing nothing to enhance security or halt the influx of desperate refugees, said Amnesty International as it published a new report today.
The organization is calling for managed, safe, legal routes into Europe and fair, efficient, rigorous screening processes that would meet the needs of refugees seeking protection in Europe and address the need for identifying possible security threats.
The report, Fear and Fences: Europe’s approach to keeping refugees at bay, reveals how moves to fence off land borders and enlist neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Morocco, as gatekeepers, have denied refugees access to asylum, exposed refugees and migrants to ill-treatment and pushed people towards life-threatening sea journeys.
“The expanding fences along Europe’s borders have only entrenched rights violations and exacerbating the challenges of managing refugee flows in a humane and orderly manner,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia.

“Giving in to fear in the wake of the atrocious attacks on Paris will not protect anyone. The numbers fleeing persecution and conflict have not gone away, nor has their entitlement to protection. In the wake of this tragedy, the failure to extend solidarity to people seeking shelter in Europe, often after fleeing the very same kind of violence, would be a cowardly abdication of responsibility and a tragic victory for terror over humanity.
“As long as there is violence and war, people will continue to come, and Europe must find better ways to offer protection. The EU and its front-line member states urgently need to rethink how they ensure safe and legal access to the EU both at its external land borders and in countries of origin and transit. This can be accomplished through the increased use of resettlement, family reunification and humanitarian visas.”

Fear and Fences, as well as a new briefing by Human Rights Watch, Europe's Refugee Crisis: An Agenda for Action, also published today, make detailed recommendations calling on the EU and its member states to do much more to tackle the global refugee crisis.
The heavy toll of Fortress Europe’s fences
In total, EU member states have built more than 235 km of fences at the EU’s external borders costing in excess of 175 million Euros, including:
a 175 km fence along the Hungary-Serbia border
a 30 km fence along the Bulgaria-Turkey border, which is to be extended by a further 130 km
18.7 km of fences along the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla with Morocco, and
a 10.5 km fence in the Evros region along the Greece-Turkey border.
Instead of stopping people from coming, these fences have only redirected refugee flows to other land routes or more dangerous sea routes. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the number of 2015 arrivals by sea into the EU reached 792,883 in November, compared to the 280,000 land and sea arrivals recorded by the EU border management agency Frontex for the entire year in 2014. So far this year, 647,581 people have arrived in Greece by sea, with 93% of arrivals coming from the world’s top 10 refugee producing countries, according to UNHCR.
As of 10 November, 512 people have lost their lives in the Aegean this year and nearly 3,500 have died in the Mediterranean as a whole.
Push-backs and other violations at borders
People who attempted to cross the Greek, Bulgarian and Spanish land borders told Amnesty International how they were pushed back by border authorities without access to asylum procedures or a chance to appeal their return, in direct breach of international law. Push-backs are often accompanied by violence and put people’s lives in danger.
A 31-year-old Syrian refugee gave a description of a typical push-back from Greece’s land border with Turkey in April this year:
“They took us to the river bank and told us to get on our knees. It was dark by this time – about 8.30pm. There were other people there who were being sent back to Turkey. One of the police hit me on my back … he hit me on my legs and on my head with a wooden stick. They took us closer to the river and told us to be quiet and not to move. They took me away from the group and started beating us with their fists and kicking us on the floor. They held me by my hair and pushed me towards the river.”

Amnesty International’s research shows that while push-backs at the Greece-Turkey land border are routine, reports of push-backs along the Bulgaria-Turkey remain constant. In March 2015, Spain adopted legislation to legalize the push-backs of migrants and refugees that Spanish civil guards have been carrying out from Ceuta and Melilla, the two Spanish enclaves in North Africa bordering Morocco. In September, Hungary established transit zones at its border with Serbia to return asylum seekers back to Serbia after expedited procedures with dubious safeguards.
“Where there are fences, there are human rights abuses. Illegal push-backs of asylum-seekers have become an intrinsic feature of any EU external border located on major migration routes and no one is doing much to stop them,” said John Dalhuisen.

“Regulating entry to the EU is one thing. Denying it to refugees altogether quite another. The first is sensible and legitimate, the second is inhuman and illegal, and has to stop.”
In a further bid to keep refugees and migrants out of Europe, the EU and its member states are increasingly turning to third countries to act as Europe’s gatekeepers.
Europe’s ‘gatekeepers’
The latest proposal on the table is for an EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan which commits Turkey to “preventing irregular migration”. The deal turns a blind eye to rights violations refugees and migrants face there. In recent months, Turkey has been detaining intercepted migrants and asylum-seekers without access to lawyers and forcibly returning refugees to Syria and Iraq, in clear violation of international law. Many non-Syrian refugees wait for more than five years to have their asylum claims processed.
Moroccan border guards have also been complicit in the ill-treatment of people attempting to scale the fences surrounding the Spanish enclaves, while asylum system reforms in the country have yet to become effective.
“The EU should not be turning to states that cannot or do not respect the rights of refugees and migrants to do their dirty work for them. Neighbouring countries should be assisted in developing asylum and reception systems. They should not be enlisted as hired hands with blithe disregard for the consequences for refugees and migrants,” said John Dalhuisen.
Recommendations to the EU
The EU can and should implement a series of achievable, realistic measures to respond to the global refugee crisis and to ensure protection for the hundreds of thousands who have already arrived in mainland Europe.

	
	
		The global refugee crisis represents a huge challenge for the EU, but it is far from an existential threat. In fact, managed, safe and legal routes into Europe would go a long way towards identifying security threats before they arrive. The EU needs to be responding not with fear and fences, but in the best tradition of the values it purports to hold dear.

Amnesty International is calling on the EU and its member states to: open up safe and legal routes, including through increasing resettlement, family reunification, and humanitarian admissions and visas;
ensure that refugees have access to territory and asylum at the EU’s external land borders;
end push-backs and other human rights violations at the borders, particularly through effective investigations into allegations of abuse at the national level, and the initiation of infringement proceedings by the EU Commission, where EU law is breached;
significantly increase reception capacity and short-term humanitarian assistance in Europe’s front-line countries; and
accelerate and extend the implementation of its relocation scheme for asylum seekers.

		Southeast Asia: Refugee crisis and freedom of expression must be tackled at ASEAN Summit
	","
		Southeast Asian leaders meeting this week in Malaysia must urgently prioritize a coordinated plan to help the thousands of asylum seekers and migrants from Myanmar and Bangladesh who are forced to risk abuse and death at sea, said Amnesty International.
Governments meeting at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Kuala Lumpur from 18-22 November cannot solely focus on economic development while there is a looming refugee crisis and an ongoing clampdown on freedom of expression in the region.
“The global refugee crisis erupted in Southeast Asia in May this year, when thousands of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh were stranded in rickety boats, pushed back from safety on shore, trafficked into forced labour, or killed at sea. ASEAN nations have an important chance at this week’s Summit to agree on urgent action to prevent this tragedy from happening again,” said Champa Patel, Amnesty International’s Interim Director for South East Asia and Pacific regional office.

 “Governments in the region – in particular Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand – must put in place strong domestic asylum systems, in line with their obligations. Customary international law is clear – people have the right to seek asylum, to have their requests fairly considered and not to be returned to a risk of torture or persecution.
“Those ASEAN member states who have yet not done so should also begin the process of ratifying the 1951 Refugee Convention.”
Freedom of expression
All governments in the region, but especially Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Viet Nam and Indonesia, must respect and protect the right to freedom of expression and repeal or amend laws that violate this right.
In Malaysia, the colonial-era Sedition Act has been used to investigate, charge or imprison hundreds of individuals who have criticized the government or the monarchy. They include opposition politicians, political activists, human rights defenders, academics, journalists, lawyers and others. Political cartoonist Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque, also known as “Zunar,” is facing nine charges under the Sedition Act for tweets criticizing the judiciary.
In Thailand, official repression of free speech has dramatically intensified. Prisoners of conscience have been arbitrarily imprisoned, routinely denied bail and tried in often unfair trials in military courts, some without the right to appeal. Authorities are using laws on lèse-majesté (insulting the monarchy) and treason to imprison scores of people for peaceful acts of self-expression. Human rights defenders continue to face censorship, enforced disappearances and violent attacks. For example, activist Sombath Boongamanong is among those facing military trial, for his criticism of the May 2014 coup.
While historic elections recently took place in Myanmar, there has been an increase in the numbers arrested and imprisoned solely for peaceful dissent during the past year. Weeks before the elections, at least 19 new prisoners of conscience were locked up adding to the scores of people already detained solely for peacefully exercise their rights. One of them is Phyoe Phyoe Aung, Secretary General of the All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU) who has been in prison along with scores of other students and protesters since 10 March 2015 after being violently arrested during a student protest against the newly adopted National Education Law.
The suppression of peaceful, social and religious activism continues in Viet Nam. Members of activist groups face regular harassment, including surveillance, restrictions on their movement, arbitrary detention, prosecution and imprisonment and physical attacks. Blogger Nguyen Huu Vinh and his colleague Nguyen Thi Minh Thuy remain in pre-trial detention since their arrest in May 2014, in connection with their blogs critical of government policies and officials.
In Indonesia, security forces arbitrarily arrested at least 264 Papuan political activists in May for peaceful protests during President Joko Widodo’s visit to the province. Scores of peaceful pro-independence activists from the Papua and Maluku regions remain imprisoned, some simply for waving a pro-independence flag. Blasphemy laws also continue to be used to repress minority beliefs.

		Southeast Asia:  Persecuted Rohingya refugees from Myanmar suffer horrific abuses at sea
	","
		Women, men and children trafficked, held in hellish conditions, beaten or killed for ransom
Fears that hundreds, maybe thousands, more refugees and migrants have perished at sea than first estimated
New “sailing season” crisis looms in Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea
Rohingya women, men and children attempting to flee persecution in Myanmar by boat earlier this year were killed or severely beaten by human traffickers if their families failed to pay ransoms, and kept in hellish, inhuman conditions, Amnesty International reveals in a new report today.
Deadly journeys: The refugee and trafficking crisis in Southeast Asia is based on interviews with more than 100 Rohingya refugees – mainly victims of human trafficking, and many of them children – who reached Indonesia after fleeing Myanmar or Bangladesh across the Andaman Sea.
With the monsoon over and a new “sailing season” already underway, thousands more could be taking to boats. Amnesty International is urging regional governments to urgently step up their response to the crisis.
“The daily physical abuse faced by Rohingya who were trapped on boats in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea is almost too horrific to put into words. They had escaped Myanmar, but had only traded one nightmare for another. Even children were not spared these abuses,” said Anna Shea, Refugee Researcher at Amnesty International.

“The shocking truth is that those we spoke to are the ‘lucky’ ones who made it to shore – countless others perished at sea or were trafficked into forced labour situations. Governments must do more to prevent this human tragedy from recurring.”
The harrowing events that unfolded in May 2015 – triggered by Thailand’s crackdown on human trafficking, and the traffickers’ subsequent abandonment of people at sea – left thousands of refugees and migrants stranded for weeks in desperate need of food, water and medical care.
While the UN estimates that at least 370 people lost their lives between January and June 2015, Amnesty International believes the true figure to be much higher. Eyewitnesses who spoke to Amnesty International saw dozens of large boats full of refugees and migrants in similar circumstances, but only five boats landed in Indonesia and Malaysia according to UN sources. Hundreds – if not thousands – of people remain unaccounted for, and may have died during their journeys or been sold for forced labour.
Deaths and beatings for money
Many Rohingya said that they had seen crew members kill people when their families failed to pay ransoms. Some people were shot by the traffickers on the boats while others were thrown overboard and left to drown. Others died because of lack of food and water or disease.
Refugees described how they were kept for months on very large boats and severely beaten while traffickers contacted their family members, demanding a ransom. One 15-year-old Rohingya girl said the crew called her father in Bangladesh, made him listen to her cries while they beat her, and told him to pay them about USD 1,700.
Virtually every Rohingya woman, man and child said they had either been beaten themselves or seen others suffer serious physical abuse. People were beaten with metal or plastic batons – sometimes for several hours – simply for begging for food, moving or asking to use the toilet. Many have been left with long-term physical or psychological scars from the violence.
Beatings were often carried out in a chillingly routine and systematic way. One 15-year old Rohingya boy said: “In the morning you were hit three times. In the afternoon you were hit three times. At night you were hit nine times.”
Persecuted at home
The Rohingyas’ desperation stems from decades of persecution and discrimination in Myanmar, where they are effectively denied citizenship under national law. Waves of violence against the Rohingya, most recently erupting in 2012, have forced tens of thousands into overcrowded camps where they live in desperate conditions.
Some people said that they had been abducted by traffickers in Myanmar or Bangladesh, whereas others had been promised a safe passage to Malaysia for a nominal fee – a tactic commonly used by traffickers looking to coerce people into forced labour.
“The Rohingya are so desperate that they will continue to risk their lives at sea until the root causes of this crisis are addressed – the Myanmar government must immediately end its persecution of the Rohingya,” said Anna Shea.

Hellish conditions
The Rohingya were kept in inhuman and degrading conditions during their journeys. Boats were severely overcrowded, with people forced to sit in extremely cramped positions, sometimes for months on end. A local man who helped rescue people off the coast of Aceh in Indonesia said that the stench was so bad that rescuers could not board.
Food and water was severely lacking and rations usually consisted of a small cup of rice per day. Many of the Rohingya who reached Indonesia were emaciated, had difficulty walking after being cramped for so long, and suffered from dehydration, malnourishment, bronchitis, and flu.
Conditions in Indonesia
In May 2015, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand initially pushed overcrowded vessels back from their shores and prevented thousands of desperate passengers from disembarking. Following international criticism, Indonesia and Malaysia eventually agreed to admit a number of asylum-seekers, on the condition that another country accept them by May 2016.
Indonesia should be recognized for devoting resources to housing hundreds of vulnerable people in its Aceh province, and working to fulfill their basic needs in cooperation with local civil society and international agencies. But there are serious unanswered questions about a long-term solution, as the government has not clarified whether the refugees can stay beyond May 2016.
Recommendations
“Without cooperation between governments to combat human trafficking, grave human rights abuses will again be perpetrated against some of Southeast Asia’s most vulnerable and desperate people,” said Anna Shea.
“Governments must ensure that initiatives against traffickers do not put people’s lives or human rights at risk, which is what happened in May 2015. They must also act quickly to implement maritime search and rescue operations.”
Amnesty International is urging Southeast Asian states to act now, and not wait for another human rights disaster at sea.

		Hundreds of refugees stranded in dire conditions on Croatia/Slovenia border
	","
		Croatian and Slovenian authorities must urgently come up with effective solutions as hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers who were stranded overnight between the two countries’ border checkpoints are soon to be joined by thousands more, Amnesty International urged today.
An Amnesty International research team on the scene interviewed multiple refugees who described how Croatian police had ushered around 1,800 people from Čakovec train station to the border crossing at Trnovec at around 2:30am, after Slovenian authorities had blocked the train from entering Slovenia.
Hundreds of children including babies as young as a month old were among the group, who walked or were carried in the rain. They reached the border crossing around two hours later, only to find it blocked by a fence and Slovenian police. Croatian police promptly erected a temporary fence behind the group, effectively trapping them between the two countries with no shelter or humanitarian assistance.
“It is simply unacceptable for Croatia, Slovenia and other countries along the route to wash their hands of any responsibility towards refugees and asylum seekers at the border while the systems in place to offer them protection are ineffective. The fact is that European leaders have known full well for months that a situation like this could arise, but have still failed to prevent it by putting in place available support mechanisms,” said Barbora Černušáková, Researcher at Amnesty International, who is currently on the Croatia-Slovenia border.

“Croatian police tried to justify their actions by telling us ‘everybody is doing it – look at Hungary’. This attitude is appalling and dangerous. If EU member states race to the bottom in terms of how they deal with the refugee crisis it could spark a domino effect with drastic consequences for thousands of people arriving daily.

Today the Slovenian police began to slowly let people into the country, with families and children given top priority. But thousands more are believed to be making their way northwards through Croatia towards the Slovenian border, so an effective solution is needed urgently.

		Catastrophic moral failure as rich countries leave millions of refugees to cruel and uncertain fates 
	","
		Eight-point plan to respond to global refugee crisis 
Only a tenth of 1.15 million most vulnerable refugees being resettled
86% of refugees now hosted in developing countries
UN refugee appeals chronically and severely underfunded
The catastrophic moral failure of world leaders who dither and squabble among themselves while callously leaving millions of people to suffer in disastrous humanitarian conditions will define their legacy for generations to come, said Amnesty International today as it released an eight-point plan to tackle the multiple global refugee crises.
Horrific violence in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and multiple conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere have brought the global refugee population to historic highs. Meanwhile Southeast Asia’s “sailing season” is again getting under way, with many more refugees likely to join the thousands of Rohingya who have fled persecution in Myanmar, only to fall prey to trafficking and other abuses.
The response to these global refugee crises has been shameful, particularly from the world’s richest countries, who have ignored appeals for humanitarian aid and to resettle vulnerable people. Wealthy countries have offered resettlement places to only around a tenth of the 1.15 million people who need them. Meanwhile developing counties are hosting millions of refugees with almost no support.
“The unprecedented multiple global refugee crises are leaving millions of people in desperation, but the response of the wealthy countries is a catastrophic failure. This is a pivotal moment which will define current world leaders’ legacy for generations to come – history will judge them very harshly unless they change course,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International.

			Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International
		
“The international refugee protection regime drawn up as a crucial safeguard after World War II risks being left in tatters if world leaders continue in their deplorable failure to protect vulnerable people fleeing war and persecution. Refugees have an international right to seek and enjoy asylum.”
Poor countries bearing the brunt
While the increase in the number of refugees reaching the European Union has dominated headlines in recent months, the reality is that poorer countries are being forced to bear the brunt of coping with the world’s multiple refugee crises. Developing countries mainly in the Middle East, Africa and Asia are currently hosting 86% of the world’s total 19.5 million refugees.
Wealthier countries are not doing nearly enough to share the burden. Humanitarian appeals for refugee crises are consistently – and often severely – underfunded. For example, as of 2 October, the UN’s humanitarian appeal for Syrian refugees was only 46% funded, while the appeal for South Sudan refugees only reached a pitiful 17% of its goal. This is having a devastating impact on refugees’ access to food, medicine and other humanitarian assistance.
“When the G20 leaders meet next month in Turkey, they should not leave the room until they have a concrete plan with clear timelines to guarantee full and sustainable humanitarian funding for the world’s multiple refugee crises; anything less will be an utter failure of leadership,” said Salil Shetty.

	
	
		Instead of rising to the challenge of this unprecedented crisis, many governments have been busy devising ways to keep people outside their borders while thousands are dying at sea or enduring squalid conditions in the shadow of razor-wire fences. This is moral bankruptcy of the highest order.

“Instead of rising to the challenge of this unprecedented crisis, many governments have been busy devising ways to keep people outside their borders while thousands are dying at sea or enduring squalid conditions in the shadow of razor-wire fences. This is moral bankruptcy of the highest order.”
Eight-point plan
Ultimately, refugee crises end when their root causes are addressed. States should seek to end conflicts and widespread human rights abuses, but these goals are difficult to achieve and take time.
However, there are things the world’s richest countries can do right now to lessen the devastating impact of the world’s refugee crises. Amnesty International is calling for concerted action in eight priority areas: 
Continuous, sufficient and predictable funding for refugee crises: all humanitarian appeals for refugee crises must be fully funded, in addition to providing meaningful financial support to countries hosting large numbers of refugees to help them provide services to refugees and their host communities. 
Fulfilling all resettlement needs identified by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR): 1.15 million vulnerable refugees currently need resettlement, according to UNHCR. Amnesty International estimates this number could increase to 1.45 million over the next two years. 
Safe and legal routes for refugees: people should not have to embark on dangerous journeys to seek their right to refuge. States should facilitate family reunification for refugees, introduce humanitarian visas to allow vulnerable refugees who do not qualify for resettlement to travel to these states and apply for asylum, and allocate a proportion of their work and student visas programmes to refugees in other countries.
Saving lives: states must prioritize saving people in distress over implementing immigration policies. In situations where people are in danger of death, including – but not limited to – people attempting sea crossings, states should invest in search and rescue operations and immediately come to the rescue of people in distress. 
Ensure access to territory for refugees arriving at borders: those seeking asylum should be allowed to enter through official border crossings, regardless of whether or not they have valid travel documents. States should refrain from taking any measures that prevent people from fleeing a country where they face persecution or violence; these include refusal of entry without visas or other documentation, push backs and border fences that prevent refugees from entering a country or forces them to take dangerous routes.
Combat xenophobia and racism: governments must refrain from engaging in xenophobia themselves, for example by implying or directly claiming asylum-seekers and migrants are to blame for economic and social problems. Governments must also reform any laws or policies that explicitly or practically result in racial or other forms of discrimination. Governments must also have effective policies to address xenophobic and racial violence. 
Combat trafficking: states must take effective action to investigate and prosecute trafficking gangs. States should offer protection and assistance to victims of trafficking and ensure they have access to refugee status determination procedures and/or resettlement opportunities. All efforts to combat trafficking and people smuggling must put people’s safety first.
Global ratification of the Refugee Convention and developing robust domestic refugee systems: states must recognize in law the right to seek and enjoy asylum, have fair domestic procedures to assess refugee claims and must guarantee refugees their fundamental rights and access to services, such as education and healthcare.

		Nauru: Foreign media refused entry after refugee rape claims
	","
		News that Nauru has refused Al Jazeera journalists permission to enter the country is just the latest development in a crackdown on freedom of expression amid fears for the detention conditions and treatment of hundreds of asylum seekers on the Pacific island state, Amnesty International said. 
The media blackout is particularly alarming when there are no independent media outlets in Nauru. It comes just days after foreign media reported on refugees being raped on the island. Nauruan authorities announced this week that they would no longer lock up asylum seekers in the detention centre they run in conjunction with the Australian government. But this positive development apparently has a dark side, as journalists from Al Jazeera’s Sydney bureau found out when they attempted to apply for media visas, only to be eventually informed this week that all media applications to visit the island are “not approved”.
“Whatever Nauru is trying to hide, it can’t be good if the authorities are so desperate to block all international media from visiting or reporting from the island,” said Meghna Abraham, Deputy Director for Global Thematic Issues at Amnesty International.

“Amid allegations of ongoing abuse, including sexual assault, of asylum seekers held on Nauru at Australia’s behest, it is all the more vital that media are neither barred nor silenced from reporting the truth.
“The Nauru authorities must immediately allow the media in and repeal criminal sanctions that undermine the right to freedom of expression, as well as allow independent human rights monitors access to the country.”
Even before this blanket block on media visits, it had been increasingly difficult for foreign journalists to access Nauru and report on the treatment of asylum seekers or other human rights issues there. In January 2014, Nauru increased the non-refundable fee for a media visa from 200 Australian Dollars (US$146) to 8,000 Australian Dollars to ($US5,868).
This fits into a broader crackdown on freedom of expression on Nauru. Five Nauruan MPs remain suspended from parliament for speaking to foreign media in the past. They have had their passports cancelled and are facing criminal charges. In May, the Nauruan government blocked all access to Facebook for a number of weeks and passed new laws providing for imprisonment for up to seven years solely for exercising the right to freedom of expression.When Amnesty International visited the migration detention centre on Nauru in 2012, researchers found the facility totally inappropriate and ill-equipped, with 387 men cramped into five rows of leaking tents, suffering from physical and mental ailments – creating a climate of anguish as the repressively hot monsoon season began.Since early 2014, the organization has three times requested permission from the government of Nauru to return. The first request was refused and subsequent requests have been ignored.
As of 31 August 2015, official statistics show that 653 people (446 men, 114 women and 93 children, including infants) are detained indefinitely at the Nauru migration detention centre.
In a recent submission the United Nations, Amnesty International raised concerns about the level of violence against women and children in Nauru. Asylum seeker children have allegedly been sexually assaulted.

		Turkey must not force shipwrecked refugees and asylum seekers to return to Syria and Iraq
	","
		The Turkish authorities must not forcibly return a group of Syrian and Iraqi refugees and asylum seekers who are currently being held in a camp against their will, after surviving a shipwreck in a boat that they say was shot at by the Turkish coastguard, said Amnesty International today.
A group of 250 mostly Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers and refugees were travelling from Turkey to Greece’s Aegean islands on 15 September. Several refugees told Amnesty International that the Turkish coastguard fired shots at their boat, which then sank. At least 22 died, including children.
“If the accounts of those on the boat are confirmed, Turkey may be responsible for the deaths of 22 people. The lack of humanity displayed by the Turkish authorities in this case is almost inconceivable. To shoot at a boat carrying people fleeing conflict and then to detain those who survived the resulting shipwreck is callous beyond belief,” said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s researcher on Turkey.

According to the Syrian refugees, the Turkish authorities told them that they will be kept in the Düziçi camp unless they agree to return to Syria. They could only do so by using dangerous border crossings under control of armed groups allegedly responsible for serious human rights abuses and war crimes. A number of Syrian refugees have already been returned directly to Syria.
A group of Iraqi asylum seekers were already released from the camp on the condition they return to Iraq. Amnesty International has spoken to one of them who is now in hiding in Baghdad, fearing for his life.
“Forcing refugees and asylum-seekers back to conflict zones violates international law and shows a complete disregard for human life. They must release all remaining asylum-seekers and refugees from the camp and grant them protection,” said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s researcher on Turkey.
Amnesty International is also calling for a prompt, independent and impartial investigation into the circumstances of the interception of the boat and the loss of 22 lives.

		EU Summit: Continuation of a failed strategy to tackle refugee crisis 
	","
		There is nothing game-changing in what EU leaders agreed to early this morning said Amnesty International today following the EU leaders’ summit on migration.
“What was needed was a bold, ambitious new approach. But what we got was the continuation of a failed strategy,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director of Europe.
“The proposed €1 billion for refugee hosting countries is positive but beyond this, the commitments disappoint. EU leaders should have been agreeing on how to ensure safe and legal routes for refugees into Europe and fixing Europe’s failing asylum system.”

“Instead, the focus of the proposals on keeping refugees out ignores the realities of a global refugee crisis and states’ obligations to provide protection to those unable to find it elsewhere.
“The relocation figures agreed yesterday won’t significantly relieve the pressure on frontline states and without much more concrete and immediate assistance to these countries, the chaotic tragic scenes we have witnessed in recent weeks, will only continue and likely worsen.
“Against this backdrop, the commitment to upholding the Dublin system looks more like wishful thinking than an informed policy decision.”

		Instead of sealing borders and deploying riot police, frontline European Union (EU) countries must allow safe access for people in need of international protection, Amnesty International said ahead of another round of high-level meetings in Brussels on the refugee crisis, amid a series of worrying border confrontations in Central Europe.
During the meetings in Brussels on 22 and 23 September, EU member states are expected to focus on the relocation of asylum-seekers throughout the EU, among other items.
“Failure is not an option. EU leaders must reach agreement on an organized and compassionate response to the arrivals of refugees and asylum seekers to Europe,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Europe Director.

“Some solutions are on the table, what is missing is the political will and leadership to see them through. EU leaders have to show leadership and face the crisis head on; not build more barriers and carry on quibbling over quotas.”
Home affairs ministers from EU member states will meet on Tuesday 22 September to attempt once more to strike a deal on the European Commission proposal to relocate 120,000 asylum-seekers within the EU, following deadlock last week. An extraordinary Summit with EU heads of state on Wednesday 23 September will discuss a broader response to the crisis, and pick up talks on relocation in the event of no deal at ministerial level.
People before borders
Along the EU’s external borders, chaos, unpreparedness and confusion has been rampant following governments’ decisions to seal them, with refugees and asylum-seekers stuck in squalid and dire conditions.
Amnesty International has documented men, women and children sleeping rough with severely restricted access to food, running water or toilets at Serbia’s border with Hungary.
“In the absence of an agreed collective response we have witnessed thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers being pushed from pillar to post, without even their basic needs being met,” said John Dalhuisen.
“This isn’t migration management; it’s an erosion of humanity.”

Relocation
So far European leaders’ responses to the refugee crisis have been lacking in ambition, and fail to help those seeking protection in Europe. A key focus of discussion at this week’s meetings, which is causing division amongst EU member states, will be on the relocation of asylum seekers within the EU, with the European Commission proposal to relocate a further 120,000 on the agenda.
Last week, member states agreed to establish a temporary and exceptional relocation mechanism for 40,000 people over two years from the frontline member states Italy and Greece to other member states. But this took more than four months of discussions, leaving serious questions over how member states will agree to relocate more.
Worryingly, the proposals do not require the consent of the person being relocated, which raises serious questions about potential detention and coercive means to force people to move to member states where they may have no family or financial support.
Amnesty International is also calling for increased EU support to improve reception conditions and ensure quick access to asylum procedures.
“As leaders gather again in Brussels, a longer term response to the refugee crisis is desperately needed. This should involve more safe and legal routes into Europe for refugees and moving towards a truly Common European Asylum system, by providing mutual recognition of asylum decisions, together with greater freedom of movement for recognized refugees,” said John Dalhuisen.

		New satellite images show Hungary’s rush to keep refugees out of Europe
	","
		New satellite images obtained by Amnesty International give a chilling new perspective on Hungary's frenzied efforts to repel refugees and asylum-seekers this week.
The organization said they serve as a warning to Croatia, Slovenia and other countries currently considering closing their borders to thousands of people seeking protection.
“The shocking scenes from the ground this week at the Horgoš-Röszke border crossing have shown the human toll of Hungary's irresponsible actions. These images give a deeper sense of the speed and scale of Hungary’s operation to seal its borders, which culminated in a dire situation for refugees and asylum-seekers left in limbo,” said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International's Crisis Response Director, who has just returned from the border.

One pair of images from 13 and 15 September starkly illustrate how sealing the border crossing near Horgoš in Serbia and Röszke in Hungary on 15 September quickly resulted in a bottleneck of trapped people seeking entry to Hungary and the European Union.
Within two days, a stretch of open motorway was suddenly bisected by a razor-wire fence, which Hungarian authorities have been erecting along the country’s entire southern border with Serbia. The satellite images show masses of people beginning to camp out in the open on the Serbian side. In the days after these images were taken, numbers swelled even further.
 
 Slide the bar left/right to see how masses of people became trapped on the Serbian side when Hungary sealed the border on 15 September.
Other images show how, before the border closed, reception points just inside the Hungarian side of the border were bustling with activity on 13 September, with lots of people and queues of buses visible. By 15 September they lay empty, with refugees and asylum-seekers forced to mass outside the fence and seek safe haven in other countries.

Amnesty International is releasing the satellite imagery just hours after Croatian authorities announced the closure of seven out of eight border crossings with Serbia after thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers blocked from entering Hungary began streaming into Croatia yesterday. Croatia and Hungary are member states of the European Union, while Serbia is not.
This sudden mass movement of people into Croatia was directly prompted by the Hungarian authorities’ border closure on 15 September. Hundreds of Hungarian soldiers, riot police, dogs and helicopters have been patrolling the completed razor-wire fence, and new laws came into force to jail anyone who attempts to break through for up to three years.
Hungary’s unlawful border crackdown
As of 11am today, the Szeged Regional Court had already found 22 people guilty of “illegal entry” to Hungary since the border closure, and received 43 new cases this morning.
Hungary is violating its international obligations by its almost blanket refusal to allow anyone access to asylum. Amnesty International is calling on Hungarian authorities to repeal amendments criminalizing ‘illegal entry’ and to provide immediate access to Hungarian territory, asylum procedure and adequate reception conditions to those in need of international protection.
According to a statement by Hungary’s Prime Minister, the government has spent “more than EUR 200 million on the reinforcement of the protection of the border this year alone”. The amount spent on reception conditions pales in comparison.
An Amnesty International research team was at the Horgoš-Röszke border crossing on 16 September, a day after the closure. They gathered shocking testimony from people staying in squalid conditions with virtually no humanitarian assistance and documented the Hungarian police using teargas and water cannon to disperse refugees and asylum-seekers, including many families with children, after a brief breach of the border defences.
Amnesty International is concerned about the proportionality of the police action, which resulted in dozens of injuries. And the organization denounced how Hungarian police separated four children from their families during the incident on 16 September. Hungary's police force has since posted a video online claiming to have reunited all the families.
“Hungary’s unlawful actions should serve as a stark warning to other governments. It's perverse to treat people fleeing war and persecution as a threat to border security, and any country that follows this example is heading down a dangerous road,” said Tirana Hassan.

		Serbia/Hungary: Refugees stuck in ‘no-man’s land’ on border amid appalling humanitarian failure
	","
		More than 1,000 people, including many families fleeing conflict in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, remain stuck in abysmal and rapidly deteriorating conditions along a Serbian motorway after Hungarian authorities closed the border crossing yesterday, Amnesty International said today from Horgoš on the Serbian side.
Humanitarian organizations, including the UN Refugee Agency, have been virtually absent so far and the Serbian authorities’ only response has been to send a handful of police to the border area. Hundreds of refugees are sleeping rough on a closed motorway, with only ad hoc aid from volunteers and severely restricted access to food, running water or toilets.
“The refugees we’ve spoken to have described the uncertainty and indignation they feel, stuck in limbo with a complete lack of information. They are effectively stuck in a no-man’s land on the Serbian border and the Hungarian border fence,” said Tirana Hassan, Director of Crisis Response at Amnesty International, from Horgoš.

“Even more refugees are streaming in today as the situation rapidly deteriorates. The Serbian authorities and the European Union knew this was going to happen and yet failed to respond adequately, meaning hundreds of the most vulnerable people are now stuck between razor wire and the abyss of not knowing what comes next.”
Amnesty International’s delegation spoke to an Afghan woman who has two young children, including an eight-year-old son with cancer. Since the Hungarian border was sealed, they have been sleeping rough, and they have very few possessions – her baby daughter doesn’t even have shoes. Their most precious belonging is her son’s medical report.
Since the area near the border crossing is open countryside along a motorway, there is no shelter or food, and severely limited toilets and running water. The refugees are doing all they can to keep the situation under control, but conditions are extremely dire – a makeshift sign in Arabic and English implored people not to “pollute the surroundings of the camp by your excrements [sic]”.
Any refugees who have tents are using them, but hundreds are sleeping rough on the motorway or the roadside. Amnesty International spoke to a family of 10 people from Syria who had a single tent in which only the children could sleep. Other families have nothing and are exposed to the elements, with some seeking shelter in nearby woods.
The aid response has been ad hoc, with no coordinated effort from the Serbian government so far. Volunteers are distributing milk and basic items, but it is a drop in the ocean in terms of the humanitarian needs. People have no access to basic needs and are unable even to feed their families, a further affront to their dignity.

Amnesty International’s researchers saw a large number of extremely vulnerable people, including many with disabilities, who have no specialized assistance of any sort. A 16-year-old girl in a wheelchair from Kobane, Syria, told the organization she and her sister were unable to check into a local hotel as they lacked documents and were forced to spend the night at the makeshift camp, where a family finally took them into their cramped tent.
Those stuck at the Serbia/Hungary border seem to have no information at all about what comes next.
People consistently told Amnesty International they were not interested in hand-outs in the long term, but want to work, live in dignified conditions and be contributing members of society. Many told the organization they do not want to be in this situation – they have to be there.
“What we are seeing along the border is how hundreds of men, women and children are suffering the dire consequences of the Hungarian authorities’ appalling lack of humanity in closing and militarizing the border yesterday,” said Tirana Hassan.

		Hungary: Refugees blocked by forces, criminalized by laws
	","
		By effectively closing its border to refugees and meeting those fleeing conflict and persecution with razor wire, troops and draconian new laws, Hungary is showing the ugly face of Europe’s shambolic response to the growing refugee crisis, said Amnesty International today.
The organization has deployed a team of researchers to the Hungary-Serbia border where dozens of soldiers, riot police, dogs and helicopters are patrolling a newly completed razor wire fence. Under new laws which come into force today refugees who attempt to break through could be jailed for up to three years.
“For refugees fleeing from terrifying conflict zones to be met by such an intimidating show of militarized force is shocking, and a woefully irresponsible response to people already traumatized by war and brutality,” said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Europe.

“While thousands more are expected to make their way to Hungary, this ‘raise the drawbridge’ mentality will simply redirect, but not put an end to, desperate and dangerous journeys.”
With the border now almost entirely sealed, Amnesty International researchers saw hundreds of refugees streaming towards a closed border post in the mistaken belief it was open. They also witnessed a group of young men from Syria desperately examining the fence to see if they could somehow break through.
“Fences and draconian laws are not a solution. These are people who are trying to get to safety. The only solution is for Hungary and the EU to start meeting their international obligations, show solidarity and ensure that asylum-seekers have orderly access to territory and asylum procedures,” said Gauri van Gulik.
“While the EU seems paralyzed, unable to find urgent, sustainable solutions, Hungary just marches onwards in the wrong direction.”

New transit zones have been established along the border with Serbia where refugees will be processed and held - but under the new laws these zones are not considered to be on Hungarian territory.
The detention of refugees and migrants should always be a measure of last resort. Amnesty International opposes criminalising refugees and migrants for irregular entry or exit, which is a disproportionate border control measure. Irregular entry should be treated as an administrative offence.
Since Serbia is considered a safe third country of transit by Hungary, Amnesty International fears that most of the refugees detained in these transit zones will have their asylum claims immediately rejected. The organisation fears that, rather than evaluating each person’s claim individually, asylum-seekers will be assessed and returned en masse to Serbia.
If an asylum seeker has his or her claim to asylum rejected they will be entitled to a judicial review but he or she will have to appeal within three days. Amnesty International is concerned about this extremely tight timeline, and about accessing legal aid in the closed transit zones.
The new laws also criminalize anyone who helps migrants and refugees cross the border with a prison sentence of between one and five years.

		European Union (EU) representatives have once again dismally failed to show collective leadership and respond to the global refugee crisis, said Amnesty International following an emergency meeting of interior ministers in Brussels.
EU interior ministers met to discuss a raft of recent European Commission proposals, including an emergency relocation mechanism to alleviate pressure on frontline member states, where refugees are suffering the fall-out of a crumbling EU asylum system. The meeting ended with the adoption of a proposal from May on the relocation of a mere 40,000 people from frontline member states, but Ministers were unable to reach agreement on a more ambitious proposals to relocate a further 120,000 people.

After extensive discussions, ministers did agree to establish a temporary and exceptional relocation mechanism for 40,000 people over two years from the frontline member states Italy and Greece to other member states. But this agreement was reached following months of discussion (the Commission made the proposal in May) and leaves tens of thousands more refugees stranded in dire conditions in the frontline member states.
Ministers failed to reach agreement to take forward the proposal to relocate 120,000 additional people, deferring it to a further Council meeting in October. In addition, the relocation proposals more generally include no allowance for the will of the person who is being relocated. This raises serious concerns around potential detention and coercive measures that could be put in place to force people to move to member states where they may have no family and limited integration prospects.

""There has been enough talk. Now is time for real action. The world is watching.""
The failure of EU countries to accept that the world refugee crisis would increase the numbers of arrivals to Europe has become increasingly visible and alarming. Ignoring the reasons pushing people to the EU such as conflict and human rights violations, EU leaders have focused on blocking their entry with abusive border control measures, as well as through practices or legislation which effectively deny them the right to seek asylum.
This, coupled with the absence of safe and legal routes to Europe, has meant an increase in refugees embarking on dangerous journeys. Both EU and member state failures have resulted in inhumane reception conditions and a lack of streamlined asylum procedures for those who arrive at frontline member states. Amnesty International has put forward a detailed and concrete set of proposals to ensure that people in need of international protection can reach and live in Europe safely and with dignity.
Dangerous journeys to Europe
This year alone almost 2,800 people have lost their lives trying to reach safety and sanctuary in Europe. Some who reach the EU’s external borders are pushed-back.
More than 381,000 people did reach the EU in the first eight months of 2015 alone, with over 258,000 arriving on the Greek islands. With 92% of those who arrived in Greece coming from war-torn Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Even having escaped the horrors of war, and surviving dangerous journeys, their hardships are far from over when they reach the EU.
Amnesty International has documented appalling reception conditions in Greece, and people being detained without food or water in Hungary. These conditions and the lack of long-term prospects in these countries are pushing people to embark on further, and often clandestine and dangerous, routes within Europe.
“The increased refugee flow to Europe is the inevitable result of the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. European leaders´ focus on keeping people out is only exacerbating people´s suffering,” said Iverna McGowan. “Despite the pleas of thousands of people across Europe that their leaders take action, the proposals on the table for Monday´s so-called emergency meeting fall dangerously short of addressing gaps and ensuring protection and dignity for those in need,” said Iverna McGowan.
Safe and legal routes to Europe
The Commission´s proposals that EU ministers will discuss on Monday make no mention of alternative safe and legal routes, such as an increase in resettlement places and humanitarian admissions, family reunification and humanitarian visas. These are necessary, however, to provide safe passage to Europe, reducing the number of refugees taking dangerous journeys. It would also reduce the pressure on frontline member states by ensuring a fairer distribution of refugees across the EU.
Amnesty International estimates that around 1.38 million resettlement places for the most vulnerable refugees around the word will be needed over the next two years, and is calling on the EU countries to offer at least 300,000 over this period, either through national programmes or a mandatory programme to be set up by the EU.
Relocation
The Commission proposal focuses on the relocation of asylum seekers within the EU as a key element of the overall solution. Though relocation would temporarily alleviate pressure from frontline member states who are in an emergency situation, it would need to be implemented swiftly. Worryingly, the proposal on the table excludes consent, raising serious questions about potential detention and coercive means to force people to move to member states where they may have no family or financial support.
Ministers will discuss an emergency relocation proposal for 120,000 asylum-seekers, on top of the 40,000 figure that the Commission also proposed in May which member states failed to fully meet.
However the Commission proposal excludes consent, raising serious questions about potential detention and coercive means to force people to move to member states where they may have no family or financial support.
“Putting relocation back on the agenda, if applied fairly, should help ease the pressure on frontline member states and lift people out of squalid reception conditions. But the current proposals are deeply concerning,” said Iverna McGowan. “Relocation alone is not a sustainable solution to helping asylum-seekers and refugees. The Commission and member states are ignoring the fact that the gravity of the situation and the plight of refugees and asylum-seekers in the countries of first arrival can be prevented in the first place with access to the wider EU through safe and legal routes.”
Freedom of movement for refugees
The Commission’s proposals also misses the opportunity to structurally address the issue of irregular movement of refugees within the EU. Long-term pressure on countries of arrival would be far better reduced by allowing free movement for refugees within the EU. Freedom of movement would also facilitate family reunifications, and increase prospects for long term integration.
'Safe Countries of Origin List'
Ministers will also discuss a proposal for a ‘Safe Countries of Origin’ list. The application of such a list is deeply alarming as it fundamentally undermines asylum seekers’ access to a fair and efficient asylum process. Refugee status determination is based on people’s individual circumstances, which means no country of origin can be deemed ‘safe’ as such. The application of a safe country of origin notion risks precluding whole groups of people in need of international protection from obtaining refugee status, and ultimately result in refoulement.

		Greece: Refugees attacked and in ‘hellish conditions' on Kos 
	","
		Today’s visit by European Commission leaders to the Greek island of Kos must result in immediate action to end the prolonged suffering of thousands of refugees, including many children, staying in inhumane conditions, Amnesty International said following a research mission on the island this week.
The organization witnessed a violent attack on refugees last night and has documented the overall dire conditions refugees face on the island. Researchers found children as young as a week old among the crowds forced to wait for days in baking heat to be registered by the local authorities, and interviewed unaccompanied minors being detained in deplorable conditions alongside adults.
 

	
	
		The refugees we met on Kos have fled war and persecution in countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. They include children, some with their families but others travelling alone. The hellish conditions the refugees are now forced to endure and the official indifference to their plight are appalling.

“The refugees we met on Kos have fled war and persecution in countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. They include children, some with their families but others travelling alone. The hellish conditions the refugees are now forced to endure and the official indifference to their plight are appalling,” said Kondylia Gogou, Greece Researcher at Amnesty International, who just returned from Kos.
Attacked by thugs
Overnight last night Amnesty staff witnessed a group of 15-25 people brandishing bats physically attack refugees on Kos, while shouting ""go back to your countries"" and other slurs. They also threatened activists, including an Amnesty International staff member. An activist who was taking photographs had her camera removed and suffered minor injuries. Police did not stop them and riot police only intervened after the physical attacks had started and used teargas to disperse the crowd.
“Last night’s violent attack once again throws into sharp relief the danger to refugees and activists who help them. Action must be taken now at all levels to ensure they are protected,” said Kondylia Gogou.

Inhumane conditions on Kos
An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 refugees were staying on the island while Amnesty International visited. In the absence of any formal reception facilities, most are staying in squalid conditions as they wait to be documented before continuing their onward journey to the Greek mainland and beyond. The majority are believed to be from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. In all, more than 31,000 refugees have arrived on Kos so far this year with a surge since June 2015, according to Greek coastguard staff.
Most of the refugees cannot afford accommodation and are sleeping in tents, out in the open in appalling conditions or in the dilapidated Captain Elias hotel. While local residents and the humanitarian NGO Médecins Sans Frontières have been providing aid, municipal authorities have provided very little assistance and have even closed public toilets.
Police on Kos are currently using an old police station to document people before they leave the island. Amnesty International researchers visited the station on 2 September and saw around 100 refugees, including a one-week-old baby girl in her mother’s arms, sitting on the ground in a courtyard. No water was provided to those waiting to be documented. The only respite from the intense summer heat was an umbrella in the middle which provided shelter to few people.
Between 200 and 300 more people were waiting to go inside the police station – many said they waited for days on end. One man, a 28-year-old from Iraq, said he had been waiting for a week.
Information on rights and the identification of vulnerable groups is not provided by the authorities, but by UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) staff deployed on the island.
The situation has often been exacerbated by the reluctance of local authorities to set up a permanent reception centre with enough capacity and the lack of a coordinated and effective response.
In mid-August these failings came to a crunch when more than 2,000 people were locked in inhumane conditions in the local sports stadium. Reports emerged of police using excessive force against refugees waiting to be registered.
Children detained with adults
Amnesty International met four boys, three Pakistanis and one Syrian, all aged 16 or 17, who were being detained in a filthy police cell alongside adult criminal suspects.
Their detention conditions were deplorable – old and dirty mattresses, no blankets, broken lights and a strong stench emanating from a nearby toilet that was filthy and flooded.
“I travelled with another refugee family to Greece…When I showed my passport, the police detained me. My family has not heard about me since I was arrested,” said a 16-year-old Syrian boy who had arrived without family members.
The boy had no access to a lawyer or legal advice in the three days since his arrest.
“With tourist families enjoying summer holidays on Kos and local families gearing up to send their kids back to school, the contrast with the suffering of the refugee children could not be starker,” said Kondylia Gogou.

Recommendations
Amnesty International is urging:
Local authorities on Kos to cooperate with the central authorities to set up reception centres and shelter new arrivals in humane conditions until the necessary registration procedures are completed. They must immediately move any unaccompanied minors into appropriate shelter until all procedures are completed and they can be transferred to reception centres for unaccompanied children in mainland Greece;
The Greek government to swiftly implement the plans announced at a press conference on 3 September, including urgently deploying First Reception Centre staff on Kos (similar to those currently on Lesvos and Samos) to assist with the identification of vulnerable groups. It must also ensure that the authority responsible for the management of European Union (EU) funds such as AMIF (Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund) starts its operations as swiftly as possible;
The EU to support the Greek authorities with emergency financial support from the EU solidarity and emergency funds to manage the current crisis. Greece also needs logistical and operational support to meet the needs of those arriving on the islands. Even more importantly, EU member states need to relieve the pressure on Greece in the longer term by significantly reforming the EU’s asylum system and by providing more safe and legal routes into Europe for those who need protection. This includes significantly increasing resettlement places for the most vulnerable refugees as identified by UNHCR, more use of humanitarian visas and better options for family reunification.
“This is a crisis at all levels. Local authorities in Greece are unwilling to provide the necessary assistance, national authorities appear unable to, and European leaders are dithering in the face of an ever-mounting humanitarian crisis,” said Kondylia Gogou.

Background
The European Commission’s First Vice-President, Frans Timmermans, and Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, will visit Kos on 4 September to monitor the situation as local authorities have struggled to manage a surge in refugee arrivals over the summer.
On 3 September, Greek government ministers met in Athens to discuss the ongoing response to the refugee crisis on the Aegean islands. The ministers announced, among other measures, the creation of a coordination centre to manage refugee arrivals; deploying further staff and machinery for the swift documentation and identification of refugees; and that steps are under way to take immediate advantage of the available EU funds. They also called on the EU to provide the financial and logistical support needed.
Police officials told Amnesty International that without additional emergency funding from the EU, it would be immensely difficult to deploy staff and equipment on the Aegean islands and to set up documentation areas where refugees would be registered in humane conditions and improve detention conditions before the end of the year.
According to Greek government figures, 157,000 refugees arrived in Greece by sea during July and August. During the first eight months of 2015, more than 230,000 people arrived by sea. This is more than 13 times the 17,000 people who arrived during the same period in 2014. The vast majority are refugees.

		Op-ed: Somalia National Human Rights Day an opportunity to enhance accountability
	","
		As Somalia marks its National Human Rights day today, both the federal government and the international community should take the opportunity to effectively put human rights and accountability at the centre of the country’s re-construction efforts and begin paving the way towards truth, justice and reparations for the victims. Such efforts are essential to peacebuilding.  Somalia’s National Human Rights Day was declared in August 2013 as part of local and international efforts to address the multiple human rights challenges faced by the country. The declaration of this day came along with other positive developments since the end of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the establishment of the federal government in 2012, including the Constitutional protection of human rights and the establishment of a National Human Rights Institution and the Ministry of Women and Human Rights.  Despite these positive developments, serious human rights abuses are still persistent and the federal government has been unable to fully comply with its obligations under international law. On the one hand, the persistence of the three-decade long civil war and constant violations of international humanitarian law continue to indiscriminately affect the civilian population. On the other hand, institutions in Somalia are still weak and human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions, unlawful restrictions on freedom of expression, and political repression are still prevalent and remain mostly unpunished.

Main actors
The main actors, their objectives and methods of warfare, as well as financing of the war have all changed over the years. The current phase involves Al Shabaab, an Islamist armed group, and the federal government’s Somali National Army (SNA), which is supported by 22,000 peacekeepers of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).  In the last two years, the narrative that peace and security have returned to many parts of central and southern Somalia has gained currency. Underpinning this narrative is the view that SNA and AMISOM forces have inflicted heavy losses on Al Shabaab and pushed the armed group out of many areas.  This narrative has informed attempts by some countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and Denmark, to force Somali refugees back to southern and central Somalia. However, forced returns violate international human rights and refugee law. 
Complicated reality
There is no doubt that the SNA-AMISOM forces have consolidated their grip on the country and forced Al Shabaab out of many areas. However, the reality is more complicated. Amnesty International has seen reports of increases in violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses by all parties to the conflict, including the federal government’s Somali National Army (SNA), the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and different armed groups like the Al-Shabaab and Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a in Galmugud and Hiraan regions, as well as Ras Kambooni in Jubbaland.  These abuses include indiscriminate killings, direct targeting of civilians, recruitment of child soldiers, rape and sexual exploitation all of which violate international human rights and humanitarian law.  Civil society organisations have reported thousands internally displaced people caused by the current SNA-AMISOM military offensive and have documented the wounding and killing of civilians in armed clashes and suicide attacks, by grenades, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and direct targeting. Media reports show that bombings targeting high profile buildings, including Villa Somalia and the Parliament in mid-2014, have resulted in tens of civilians injured and killed.  Moreover, child soldiers continue to be recruited by different groups to the conflict, as documented by a United Nations report issued on 5 June 2014. Other civil society organizations have also documented the sexual exploitation and rape of internally displaced persons and Somali women by both armed groups and AMISOM peacekeepers.  In parallel, the federal government has been unable to strengthen the State’s institutions in several parts of the country to ensure the full respect and protection of human rights. Repression against opponents and critics of the government, unlawful restrictions on freedom of expression, attacks against journalists and the continuation of the death penalty after trials which do not meet international standards are only examples of the prevalent human rights violations in the country.  However, all these violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have remained unpunished.
Dealing with human rights abuses
As Somalia marks its National Human Rights Day, attention must be paid to the capacity of the federal government and AMISOM to ensure full respect and protection for human rights, including access to justice and adequate reparations for victims.  The UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) has the mandate to monitor, prevent, investigate and report human rights violations or violations of international humanitarian law in Somalia. While UNSOM has initiated a training programme for the SNA and AMISOM in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2124, it still needs to improve the programme and strengthen its monitoring so as to contribute to preventing human rights abuses.  All parties to the conflict must refrain from human rights abuses, including targeting of civilians, sexual violence, and the recruitment of child soldiers. It is crucial that the federal government and AMISOM guarantee access to justice and ensure independent, impartial and effective investigations into human rights violations, hold to account all those responsible and provide adequate reparations to all victims. Further, Somalia must take the appropriate steps towards abolishing the death penalty.  The National Human Rights Day can be thus a good opportunity to bring to the centre Somalia’s human rights obligations and begin the process of ensuring the rights to truth, justice and reparations to all victims.

		Greece: Chaos and squalid conditions face record number of refugees on Lesvos 
	","
		Weak coordination and severe shortages in facilities and staffing are creating dreadful conditions for the hundreds of refugees and migrants arriving every day on the Greek island of Lesvos, which is seeing the highest number of arrivals in Greece, Amnesty International said after a research team returned from the island.
Overloaded, under-resourced authorities are failing to cope with the dramatic increase in the number of people arriving on the island (33,000 since 1 August) and must rely on local volunteers, NGO activists, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and tourists to step into the massive breach. The vast majority are fleeing conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria - 90% of those arriving in 2015 according to UNHCR.

	
	
		The arduous odyssey faced by people fleeing conflict does not end on Greece’s shores.
	

		
			Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia.
		
“The arduous odyssey faced by people fleeing conflict does not end on Greece’s shores. Forced to walk long distances in searing heat and stay in squalid camps or out in the open, refugees and asylum seekers see little alternative but to continue their journey, contributing to the disaster we’ve seen on the Macedonian border in recent days,” said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia.
“This is not just a Greek tragedy, but a Europe-wide crisis. It is unfolding before the eyes of short-sighted European leaders who prioritize securing borders over helping survivors of conflict. The world is seeing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. What Europe’s borders need is not fences but safe entry points for refugees, and facilities to receive them with dignity.”
On 24 August, police on Lesvos told Amnesty International that they estimate that more than 33,000 refugees and migrants had arrived on the island since 1 August. Hundreds more are arriving every day - 1,450 on the night of 10-11 August alone.
While Kos, Chios and other Greek islands in the Aegean have also received refugees and migrants crossing over via Turkey, Lesvos has received the highest number: more than 93,000 already in 2015, more than seven times the 12,187 arrivals in all of 2014. More than 160,000 migrants and refugees have entered Greece as a whole so far this year, compared to 45,412 in all of 2014.
Overcrowded, squalid conditions
Amnesty International observed very poor, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding at the Moria immigration detention centre on Lesvos, including overflown toilets, lack of sheets and blankets, filthy and old mattresses and broken beds. Police on Lesvos said they lack the funds to improve conditions.
A refugee from Afghanistan told Amnesty International:
“Words cannot describe [the conditions] … it smells … there is no soap, no clothes and everything is broken. … There is nothing for the small children, not even milk … [the police] shout a lot ... Yesterday morning they cut the electricity and until lunch time we had no electricity and it was smelling a lot in our rooms [so we slept outside]…”.
People waiting outside the overcrowded centre for space to free up have been staying in tents, underneath nets from olive groves, or enduring 35-degree heat with no shelter at all.
Syrian refugees housed in tents in a car park
Syrian refugees arriving on Lesvos are being sent to the separate Kara Tepe camp, where they wait one to two days for documents that allow them to travel onwards to Athens. Kara Tepe is an informal, unmanaged camp set up by the local mayor on a car park.
Intended for 500 people, it is very overcrowded with more than 1,500 people staying there at a time. There are not enough tents, toilets or showers. Food is distributed by police and NGOs, with little coordination from Greek authorities. It falls to the NGO Médecins Sans Frontières to clear the garbage and clean and maintain the toilets and showers.
Migrants and refugees forced to walk for miles With only four buses available to transport the hundreds of people coming ashore every day, most have to walk the up to 70 km journey from the island’s northern shores to the reception centre in the capital, Mytilene.
Amnesty International witnessed more than 100 mainly Syrian and Afghan refugees, including families with small children and elderly people, walk to the point of collapse in temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius. In the absence of help from the authorities, locals, tourists and activists gave them water and food.

			Syrian refugees on Lesvos
		
 
Syrian refugees told Amnesty International how arduous the journey was for families and the elderly:
“There are women with babies and there is no bus … We are young and we will make it but what about them?”
Understaffing prolongs ordeal
Once they arrive in the island’s capital Mytilene, people wait to be registered by the coastguard. Amnesty International witnessed lines of around 200 people waiting in welting heat. There are neither interpreters to help the coastguard process arrivals nor enough volunteer doctors to examine any beyond the most urgent cases.
Members of the Greek Coastguard told Amnesty International they have only 10 staff to register the hundreds of refugees arriving daily, though they receive support from NGOs who provide information and medical assistance.
Island refugee crisis demands emergency plan
Amnesty International is calling on Greek authorities, with urgent EU financial and logistical support, to set up an emergency response to manage the crisis on Lesvos and other Greek islands. Authorities need to urgently open the new First Reception Centre in Moria and to provide:
More staff in mobile first reception units as well as more police, coastguards, and interpreters to help deal with new arrivals.
More buses to transport people to Mytilene, the Moria detention centre and Kara Tepe camp.
Better conditions at the informal camps and at the port, with basic services such as health care, shelter, water and more toilets and showers.
Effectively and quickly use EU funds to improve reception conditions.
Official management for informal camps that have been setup to deal with the influx of people.
New reception centres in the north of Lesvos where most refugees and migrants are arriving.

	
	
		The economic and refugee crises are converging on Lesvos and the other islands of the Aegean, with refugees and migrants paying the price.
	

		
			Gauri van Gulik
		
“The economic and refugee crises are converging on Lesvos and the other islands of the Aegean, with refugees and migrants paying the price,” said Gauri van Gulik.
“Announced EU funds can help Greece respond, but it is becoming clear that Greece also needs operational support to put these funds to use. Even more importantly, Europe needs to relieve pressure off Greece in the longer term by providing more safe and legal routes into Europe for those who need protection. As long as it fails to do so, Europe is directly responsible for what is unfolding on Lesvos and other frontline points of the refugee crisis.”
Background: Crisis also increases pressure in Macedonia and Serbia
The crisis in Greece also increases pressure in Macedonia and Serbia, as thousands leave Greece and pass through the western Balkans to re-enter the European Union in Hungary. Amnesty International has documented failed asylum systems and human rights violations along this route recently. Late last week, Macedonia declared a state of emergency along the Greek border as thousands of mainly Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi refugees and asylum-seekers were trapped at the border.
Early this morning, a boat carrying 15 refugees capsized near Skala Mystegnon on Lesvos. According to unconfirmed reports, following a search-and-rescue operation eight refugees have been rescued, two have drowned and the coastguard is still looking for five more people.
On 25 June 2015, Amnesty International warned that Greek islands were struggling with the influx of refugees and called on EU leaders to act.

		Macedonia: Thousands trapped and at risk of violence as border sealed
	","
		Thousands of mainly Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi refugees and asylum-seekers are trapped and face a serious risk of violence after Macedonian authorities sealed the country’s southern border on Thursday, creating a new crisis zone amid the global refugee crisis, Amnesty International said. 
The situation rapidly deteriorated when the government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Macedonia) declared two border areas “crisis regions”, closed the southern border crossing with Greece just outside the town of Gevgelija, and called in military backup.
Amnesty International has received extremely worrying reports that an anti-terrorism police unit deployed to the border have used beatings and riot-control agents and even fired in the air to prevent people from crossing into Macedonia. Barbed wire fences have also been erected along the border.
“Every country has the power to patrol its own borders, but this kind of para-military response is an unacceptable push-back in violation of international law. Macedonian authorities are responding as if they were dealing with rioters rather than refugees who have fled conflict and persecution,” said Gauri van Gulik, Deputy Europe Director at Amnesty International.

“If the reports of beatings and firearm use by the security forces are true, this would mark a very dangerous escalation of an already tense situation. “All countries have a duty to protect those fleeing conflict and persecution, and Macedonia is no exception. When the system cannot cope, you improve the system – you don’t just stop people from coming in.”
Violent push-backs
A witness on the Greek side of the border told Amnesty International that Macedonia’s Rapid Reaction Unit, an anti-terrorist police unit, had been beating refugees and asylum-seekers who were trying to enter Macedonia, and firing over their heads. A local NGO confirmed the use of rubber bullets.
Media reports and video have surfaced of Macedonian police using riot control agents and truncheons to beat people who did not seem to be posing any threat. The Ministry of Interior has issued a statement saying that stun grenades had been used.
A Syrian man spoke to Amnesty International from near Eidomeni on the Greek side of the border. He said that in the past two days, the Macedonian military have been preventing at least 1,000 people in that area, including families and lots of small children, from crossing the border. Groups of around 10 Macedonian troops in military uniform were positioned about every 50 metres along the border.
The Macedonian authorities must ensure that any police and military forces deployed along the border respect international law and standards on the use of force and firearms.

Fears of a growing crisis
With more than 1,000 asylum-seekers and refugees seeking entry into Macedonia every day in order to board trains at Gevgelija, there are growing concerns that the crisis could rapidly deteriorate. Many of those arriving are in poor health and need medical assistance – which has been provided up until now by the Macedonian Red Cross.
According to the Macedonian NGO Legis, which provides aid to refugees at Gevgelija train station, many of those arriving from Syria show signs of injuries sustained as a result of the armed conflict.
It appears there is little medical assistance available to those trapped on the Greek side of the border. The Syrian refugee Amnesty International interviewed said he and others had not eaten for two days, and are in desperate need of food, medical assistance and shelter. Instead of sealing off the border, the Macedonian and Greek authorities must focus on providing shelters, food, clothing and healthcare, with help from the international community if needed.
Amnesty International is urging the Macedonian authorities to live up to its international obligations towards refugees and asylum-seekers, including by:
Allowing those who want to seek asylum in the country to do so and provide them access to a prompt and effective refugee status determination process;
Refraining from any excessive use of force against refugees and asylum seekers; Providing shelter, food, clothing and healthcare; and
Ensuring effective reception conditions that allow for the identification and assistance of unaccompanied children and other vulnerable individuals.
Background
In July 2015, Amnesty International released a report, Europe’s Borderlands: Violations against refugees and migrants in Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, which documented how refugees and migrants at Macedonia’s border with Greece were routinely subjected to unlawful push-backs and ill-treatment by border police.
On 19 June this year, amendments to Macedonia’s Law on Asylum were introduced with the intention of increasing access to asylum. They enabled asylum-seekers to register at the border, and provided them with a 72-hour pass to remain legally in the country in order to access the asylum system, with the right to use health services and public transport.
However, most asylum-seekers used this pass to travel through Macedonia and onwards through Serbia, into Hungary. Their journey through the country was assisted by the authorities, who provided subsidized trains from Gevgelija, just over the Greek border, to Tabanovce, on the border with Serbia.
These measures, according to the government, aimed to protect asylum-seekers in Macedonia from attacks by armed gangs, exploitation by smugglers - including kidnapping for ransom, and from the dangers of walking along the railway lines while walking through Macedonia, where 29 people have been killed by trains to date.
All of this provided asylum-seekers with a safe and legal route through Macedonia: only 47 people, 37 of them Syrian nationals, applied for asylum between 20 June and 17 August, despite thousands passing through the country in that time period.
Amnesty International has previously documented the failures of the asylum system in Macedonia. A meagre 10 people received asylum in 2014, and none in any other year since 2009.
This month, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, advised that asylum-seekers should not be returned to Macedonia, on the basis that the system was still unable to provide international protection.

		Latest Mediterranean shipwreck underscores urgent need for safe, legal routes to Europe 
	","
		European governments must do more to provide safe and legal ways for people in need of protection to enter the European Union (EU), rather than risking their lives at sea in their thousands, Amnesty International said as a massive search-and-rescue operation got under way in the central Mediterranean earlier today.Media reports say hundreds of people are feared lost at sea after a fishing boat, which carried an estimated 600 people, capsized off the Libyan port of Zuwara. According to official sources, 373 people have been rescued and 25 bodies were retrieved. Rescue operations, carried out with the participation of vessels from various countries as well as NGOs Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), are ongoing and will continue overnight.“People are still crossing the central Mediterranean in their thousands almost every week to seek safety and better lives in Europe, so fatal incidents at sea are going to remain a tragic reality,” said Denis Krivosheev, Deputy Europe and Central Asia Director at Amnesty International.

	
	
		Today’s fatal incident emphasizes how European governments must immediately put in place safe and legal routes for those in need of protection to reduce the numbers of people embarking on perilous sea journeys.

“Today’s fatal incident emphasizes how European governments must immediately put in place safe and legal routes for those in need of protection to reduce the numbers of people embarking on perilous sea journeys.""It is the first incident of this scale since EU governments agreed to scale up search-and-rescue operations in late April, which curtailed an unprecedented surge in deaths at sea in the early months of 2015.Amnesty International is calling for increased pledges to resettle refugees, expanded access to Europe through humanitarian visas and family reunification, and an easing of restrictions on freedom of movement of successful asylum seekers.
“While refugees and migrants are continuing to access to Europe through dangerous journeys, it is imperative that efforts to save lives at sea are given top priority. Humanitarian operations launched by European governments in the aftermath of the April shipwrecks, when more than 1,200 people died or disappeared at sea, must continue to be properly resourced and implemented,” said Denis Krivosheev.

		Hungary: Change to Asylum Law puts tens of thousands at risk
	","
		A looming change in Hungary’s Asylum Law could put tens of thousands of asylum-seekers fleeing war and persecution at risk as the country continues to flout its obligations amid Europe’s burgeoning refugee crisis, Amnesty International said.
The amendment, which enters into force on 1 August, may lead to a situation in which any asylum-seeker who enters the country via its Balkan neighbours will be rejected and deported back. The Hungarian authorities are also constructing a four-metre-high fence along 175 km of the border with Serbia to prevent refugees and migrants from crossing.
Amnesty International is calling on Hungarian Parliamentarians to submit the legislation for review by the Constitutional Court.
“This is a thinly veiled attempt by Hungary to dodge its obligations under national and international law to assist asylum-seekers who have a globally recognized right to claim international protection,” said John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia Director at Amnesty International.

“It is not up to the authorities in Hungary – or any other country – to deny asylum-seekers access to an individual assessment of their claim. Hungary has an obligation to assist those who apply for asylum and treat each application on a case-by-case basis.”
Under the change, access to an asylum procedure could be denied to asylum-seekers who first pass through a list of countries the Hungarian authorities have deemed “safe”, including Serbia and Macedonia. Anyone who simply transited through those countries, regardless of their country of origin, could be rejected.
Hungary has seen a spike in anti-refugee rhetoric and actions following an increase in the number of migrants and asylum-seekers entering via the Balkans. According to the NGO Hungarian Helsinki Committee, as of 10 July 2015, 99% of those who have applied for asylum in Hungary since the beginning the year – or 86,000 people – entered the country through Serbia.
In a report released earlier this month, Amnesty International documented the devastating consequences for migrants and asylum-seekers traveling through the Balkans. The asylum systems in Macedonia and Serbia are ineffective and fail to guarantee international protection to those in need.
Failures in the implementation of Serbia’s Asylum Law have resulted in the majority of asylum applications being suspended or discontinued. This places large numbers of people at risk of being sent onwards to Macedonia and Greece. In 2014, out of 388 asylum applications in Serbia, refugee status was granted to only one person – a Tunisian national –and five Syrians were afforded subsidiary protection due to the ongoing armed conflict in their home country.
“This situation is simply untenable – countries in Europe’s borderlands are facing an unprecedented flow of migrants and asylum-seekers, but passing them from pillar to post is not a solution and does not absolve countries like Hungary and Serbia of their legal obligations,” said John Dalhuisen.

Background
Following the adoption of an Amendment to the Asylum Law by the National Assembly in June, the Hungarian government issued a decree on 21 July specifying the lists of the “safe countries of origin” and “safe third countries”. They include EU Member States, Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Member States of the European Economic Area, states of the USA that have abolished the death penalty, Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
In July, the National Assembly adopted another Amendment of the Asylum Law, clarifying that the asylum applications of nationals of designated “safe countries of origin” will be decided in an expedited procedure. The applications of asylum-seekers coming through “safe third countries” will be declared inadmissible. This Amendment will enter into force on 1 August.
The blanket refusal of asylum applications submitted by people who travelled through these countries can result in refoulement, the unlawful return of persons who would be at risk of serious human rights violations.

		Balkans: Refugees and migrants beaten by police, left in legal limbo and failed by EU 
	","
		Thousands of refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants – including children – making dangerous journeys across the Balkans are suffering violent abuse and extortion at the hands of the authorities and criminal gangs and being shamefully let down by a failing European Union (EU) asylum and migration system which leaves them trapped without protection in Serbia and Macedonia, said Amnesty International in a new report.

	
	
		Serbia and Macedonia have become a sink for the overflow of refugees and migrants that nobody in the EU seems willing to receive

Europe’s borderlands: Violations against migrants and refugees in Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, finds that an increasing number of vulnerable people are being left stranded in legal limbo across the Balkans. The situation is exacerbated by push-backs or deportations at every border, restricted access to asylum en route and a lack of safe and legal routes into the EU.  “Refugees fleeing war and persecution make this journey across the Balkans in the hope of finding safety in Europe only to find themselves victims of abuse and exploitation and at the mercy of failing asylum systems,” said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia.  “Serbia and Macedonia have become a sink for the overflow of refugees and migrants that nobody in the EU seems willing to receive.”  The report is based on four research missions to Serbia, Hungary, Greece and Macedonia between July 2014 and March 2015 and interviews with more than 100 refugees and migrants. Their testimonies reveal shocking conditions facing those who travel the western Balkans route – which has overtaken the Mediterranean route to become the busiest irregular passage to the EU. The number of people apprehended crossing the Serbia-Hungary border alone has risen by more than 2,500% since 2010 (from 2,370 to 60,602).  The route which takes refugees and migrants by sea from Turkey to Greece and then over land across Macedonia to Serbia and into Hungary is less deadly than the sea crossing from Libya but it is still fraught with dangers and obstacles. Since January 2014, 123 refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants have drowned attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Greece and 24 were killed on railways.

    
  null‘We are going from death to death’  Arrivals to the Greek islands – including children – face appalling reception conditions and most travel to Athens before attempting to cross into Macedonia en route to other EU countries. At Macedonia’s border with Greece, and at Serbia’s border with Macedonia, refugees and migrants are routinely subjected to unlawful push-backs and ill-treatment by border police. Many are forced to pay bribes. One witness told Amnesty International that Serbian Border Police near the Hungarian border threatened to return his group to Serbia if they refused to pay €100 each.  One Afghan refugee told Amnesty International how he was part of a group pushed back to Greece by Macedonian police. “I saw men badly beaten. They beat my 13-year-old son. They beat me too,” he said.  Some of those interviewed by Amnesty International had been pushed back more than 10 times, in operations that often take place well inside the Macedonian border.  Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers reported being pushed, slapped, kicked and beaten by Serbian police near the border with Hungary and an Afghan refugee told Amnesty International that “a woman who is five months pregnant was beaten”.  Refugees and migrants are also vulnerable to financial exploitation by smugglers and attacks by criminal groups. Two Nigerian men told Amnesty International how they were held up in Macedonia: “Nine men attacked us with knives. We went to the police to ask for help…but they arrested us”. ‘If you die here, nobody will come and ask about you’  Many refugees and migrants are arbitrarily detained by the authorities. Hundreds, including families, pregnant women and unaccompanied children, are detained for prolonged periods at Macedonia’s Reception Centre for Foreigners – known as Gazi Baba - without any legal safeguards or any opportunity to claim asylum. Many are held unlawfully for months in inhuman and degrading conditions so they can act as witnesses for the Macedonian prosecution in criminal proceedings against smugglers.  “In Gazi Baba there were about 400-450 people when we entered…People were sleeping even on the stairs, the overcrowding was terrible. There were mattresses on the floors and in the corridor,” a Syrian refugee told Amnesty International.  Former detainees told Amnesty International that they had been beaten, or witnessed beatings, by police officers in Gazi Baba and one described how, when some Syrians threatened to go on hunger strike, a policeman told them: “If you die here, nobody will come and ask about you. We will throw your dead body out.” Failing asylum systems  Individuals who attempt to seek asylum in Serbia or Macedonia face severe obstacles. In 2014, only 10 asylum seekers were granted refugee status in Macedonia and only one was granted asylum in Serbia. Discouraged by the slow progress in processing asylum applications, most asylum seekers continue their journey into Hungary, where they face further violations of their rights.  Those detected entering Hungary irregularly are routinely detained, often in overcrowded and degrading conditions, or ill-treated by police officers. In 2014 Hungary granted asylum to 240 people – a small minority of the total number of applications.  While the majority of detained asylum-seekers are later released to open reception centres, those considered at risk of absconding remain in detention centres. Those who do not want to claim asylum in Hungary, which includes many hoping to claim asylum in other EU countries, are typically deported to Serbia and, in some cases, onward to Macedonia. Here they are left without legal status, protection or support and are vulnerable to further human rights violations.

	
	
		Serbia and Macedonia have to do much more to respect migrants and refugees’ rights. But it is impossible to separate the human rights violations there, from the broader pressures of the flow of migrants and refugees into and through the EU, and a failed EU migration system
	

		
			Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International
		
Flawed EU migration policies  The ever-growing number of migrants and refugees taking the Balkan route is a consequence of a broader failure of EU migration and asylum policy, over which Serbia and Macedonia have no control. Placing the primary responsibility for processing asylum applications on the first EU country of entry and limiting safe and legal avenues of entry has put an unsustainable strain on the EU’s outer fringes and neighbouring states.  Rather than prioritizing improvements to the asylum systems of countries along the Balkan route, the EU has instead invested heavily in its efforts to strengthen their “border management” systems.  “Serbia and Macedonia have to do much more to respect migrants and refugees’ rights. But it is impossible to separate the human rights violations there, from the broader pressures of the flow of migrants and refugees into and through the EU, and a failed EU migration system.” said Gauri van Gulik.  “As increasing numbers of vulnerable refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants become trapped in a Balkan no-man’s land, the pressures on Serbia and Macedonia are mounting. These stresses, like those on Italy and Greece, can only be resolved by a much broader rethink of EU migration and asylum policies.” Read more:Europe’s Borderlands: Violations against refugees and migrants in Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary (Report, 7 July 2015)

NOTES: Figures collated by Amnesty International reveal that, between 1 January and 22 June 2015, 61,256 migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees arrived in Italy whilst 61,474 arrived in Greece.  Of more than 21,000 refugees and migrants that took the Western Balkans route in 2014, more than half were from Syria and others came from Afghanistan, Egypt, Eritrea, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan and Tunisia.  Since March 2015, Hungary’s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister ratcheted up anti-migration rhetoric, including threats of legislation to allow the immediate detention and return of any irregular migrants and of building a border fence to prevent refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants from crossing into Hungary from Serbia. On 30 June, Hungary’s Parliament gave the government a green light to draw up a list of “safe” transit states where it believes refugees could have sought asylum before reaching Hungary. The list is most likely to include Serbia, where they are not guaranteed access to asylum and are at risk of deportation.  Amnesty International’s report sets out recommendations to reduce pressures on states which result from the failure of the EU to develop migration policies that reflect the need for both greater global solidarity, in response to the ever-growing refugee crisis, and greater internal solidarity between EU member states that currently share the responsibility for receiving asylum seekers unequally.

		Congo-Brazzaville: Mass deportations of DRC nationals may amount to crimes against humanity
	","
		Police violence, persecution, arbitrary detentions and rape amid a security operation to deport tens of thousands of DR Congo nationals from Congo-Brazzaville last year were part of widespread attacks that could amount to crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said in a new report today.
The organization calls for a halt of all current plans of mass expulsions of foreign nationals from the Republic of Congo and for all of those unlawfully expelled to be allowed to return, if they so desire.
Operation Mbata ya Bakolo: mass expulsions of foreign nationals in the Republic of Congo documents a range of human rights violations and crimes under international law committed by Congolese security forces and others from April to September last year. During this period, at least 179,000 DRC nationals, including many refugees and asylum seekers, were rounded up, arbitrarily arrested, and forced to leave Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville).

	
	
		Mbata ya Bakolo was marked by widespread attacks that could amount to crimes against humanity
	

		
			 Evie Francq, Amnesty International DRC researcher.
		
“Our research includes numerous testimonies showing that, in the rush to round up DRC nationals, police frequently used excessive force, carried out arbitrary arrests, extorted money and belongings, destroyed property and, in some cases, even raped women and girls. To date, no criminal investigation or prosecution seems to have taken place. The Republic of Congo has a clear obligation to bring to justice those suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law.”
Mass deportations
Operation “Mbata ya Bakolo” (which means “slap of the elders” in Lingala) was a large-scale security response to a perceived rise in criminality, which the Republic of Congo authorities blamed on members of “kuluna” (criminal gangs) from neighbouring DRC. Officially, the operation focused on “illegal migrants”, but in practise DRC nationals were quickly targeted irrespective of their migration status.
During the operation between April and September 2014, forcible returns of asylum seekers and refugees were common, in violation of international law. The deportations were nationwide, with arrivals of DRC nationals registered at 33 border posts. In Brazzaville, after arbitrarily arresting DRC nationals, police transported them to the port known as the Beach – the city’s main point for crossing the border to Kinshasha, DRC, on the opposite bank of the Congo River.
Jacqueline (not her real name), a DRC national living in Brazzaville since 2009, told Amnesty International how the round-ups were completely arbitrary:
“On Friday 2 May [2014] we were at home in the Moungali neighbourhood of Brazzaville when the neighbourhood chief and the police arrived at our house. They told us anyone from the DRC had to leave. … We are legal in Brazzaville but they refused to even look at our identity papers! We took some clothes and were forced on a boat to Kinshasa. I am here now with four children and we are living on the streets. We are abandoned now. We are in danger here.”
Almost half of the 112 people Amnesty International interviewed said they had been arbitrarily arrested, some of them multiple times, during the operation.
Fears of police violence and growing xenophobia led many others to return to DRC of their own initiative. Marie (not her real name), a 35-year-old DRC national, told Amnesty International about the overcrowded, inhumane conditions at the Beach as they awaited their departure to DRC:
“I spent two days on the Beach before leaving [to DRC]. During those two days, there were children that were dying and even women giving birth on the spot. I witnessed a delivery myself. The baby died because of suffocation. I slept outside with my four children and there were a lot of people. The police trampled them and pushed them. And even though the boat was free, they asked for money to let us enter into it. I gave $US40 to a policeman to get into the boat.”
Violence and rape
Besides extorting DRC nationals for money or belongings, survivors also described how Republic of Congo security forces used physical violence, including rape, to humiliate and intimidate them.
A 21-year-old mother explained how six policemen entered her house at 3am and raped her while she was home alone with her four-year-old daughter:
 
 

	
	
		They took off my clothes and started to rape me one by one. As I was fighting them and tried to resist, they told me they would show me how a Brazzavillois treats a Zairois [DRC national]: like a dog. One of them tied my arm and the other one injured me with an instrument.
	

		
			null
		
Amnesty International also documented the rape of four others, including a five-year-old girl.
Xenophobia against DRC nationals
Republic of Congo police made considerable use of the media to publicize operation ‘’Mbata ya Bakolo’’, going on radio and TV and using megaphones to encourage the general population to identify the presence of “criminal households”. Recording artists composed songs that incited discrimination and included lyrics such as “the Ngala [foreigners or DRC nationals] are going home now, let us save our jobs and let them go”.
As a result, xenophobia was widespread and DRC nationals were threatened, bullied and harassed by their neighbours and people in the street. They lost their jobs and ability to support themselves and their families. Some were forced to sleep on the streets after being evicted from their homes after police introduced a US$600 fine on landlords with “illegal tenants”.
An asylum seeker from the DRC and mother of nine children told Amnesty International:
“They threatened me at the market saying, ‘We are going to take care of you. You will see.’ The neighbours say they are tired of us, they throw stones at us, and they cut our house off of the electricity grid. Our children don’t go to school anymore because we are scared they will be taken and sent back to Kinshasa.”
“Given this rampant xenophobia fuelled by the authorities, many DRC nationals felt they had no choice but to leave the Republic of Congo. The government has called these departures voluntary, but they are in fact disguised deportations and a violation of international law. The authorities must end all official discrimination and urgently address xenophobic attitudes in the wider society,” said Evie Francq.
West Africans now targeted
Amnesty International is also alarmed by a new wave of arrests, detentions and deportations, now targeting West African nationals, since 14 May 2015 in the city of Pointe-Noire.
“The Republic of Congo government must immediately halt this new phase of the operation, and guarantee there will not be a repeat of last year’s mass deportations,” said Evie Francq.

		World leaders’ neglect of refugees condemns millions to death and despair
	","
		 
· Worst refugee crisis since World War II. · One million refugees desperately in need of resettlement. · Four million Syrian refugees struggling to survive in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. · More than three million refugees in sub-Saharan Africa, and only a small fraction offered resettlement since 2013. · 3,500 people drowned while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea in 2014 -- 1,865 so far in 2015. · 300 people died in the Andaman Sea in the first three months of 2015 due to starvation, dehydration and abuse by boat crews.
World leaders are condemning millions of refugees to an unbearable existence and thousands to death by failing to provide essential humanitarian protection, said Amnesty International as it published a new briefing in Beirut today, ahead of World Refugee Day on 20 June.
The Global Refugee Crisis: A conspiracy of neglect explores the startling suffering of millions of refugees, from Lebanon to Kenya, the Andaman Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and calls for a radical change in the way the world deals with refugees.
“We are witnessing the worst refugee crisis of our era, with millions of women, men and children struggling to survive amidst brutal wars, networks of people traffickers and governments who pursue selfish political interests instead of showing basic human compassion,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.

			Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
		
“The refugee crisis is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, but the response of the international community has been a shameful failure. We need a radical overhaul of policy and practice to create a coherent and comprehensive global strategy.”
Amnesty International is setting out a proposal to reinvigorate the system for refugee protection and urging states to make firm commitments to live up to their individual legal obligations and renew their commitment to international responsibility-sharing. Amongst the actions Amnesty International is urging governments to take are:
· A commitment to collectively resettle the one million refugees who currently need resettlement over the next four years.
· To establish a global refugee fund that will fulfil all UN humanitarian appeals for refugee crises and provide financial support to countries hosting large numbers of refugees. · The global ratification of the UN Refugee Convention.
· To develop fair domestic systems to assess refugee claims and guarantee that refugees have access to basic services such as education and healthcare.
“The world can no longer sit and watch while countries like Lebanon and Turkey take on such huge burdens. No country should be left to deal with a massive humanitarian emergency with so little help from others, just because it happens to share a border with a country in conflict,” said Salil Shetty.

“Governments across the world have the duty to ensure people do not die while trying to reach safety. It is essential that they offer a safe haven for desperate refugees, establish a global refugee fund and take effective action to prosecute trafficking gangs. Now is the time to step up protection for refugees, anything less will make world leaders accomplices in this preventable tragedy.”
Syria: World’s largest refugee crisis More than four million refugees have fled Syria, 95% of them are in just five main host countries: Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt.
These countries are now struggling to cope. The international community has failed to provide them, or the humanitarian agencies supporting refugees with sufficient resources. Despite calls from the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, far too few resettlement places have been offered to Syrian refugees.
The situation is so desperate that some of Syria’s neighbours have resorted to deeply troubling measures, including denying desperate people entry to their territory and pushing people back into the conflict.
Since the beginning of 2015, Lebanon has severely restricted entry to people fleeing Syria. The Lebanese authorities issued new guidelines whereby Syrian nationals are required to fulfil specific criteria in order to enter. Since these criteria were imposed, there has been a significant drop in registration of Syrian refugees – in the first three months of 2015 UNHCR registered 80% fewer Syrian refugees than in the same period in 2014.
Mediterranean: The most dangerous sea route The Mediterranean is the most dangerous sea route for refugees and migrants. In 2014, 219,000 people made the crossing under extremely dangerous conditions and 3,500 died attempting it.
In 2014, the Italian authorities rescued over 170,000 people. However in October 2014, Italy, under pressure from other EU member states, cancelled the rescue operation, Mare Nostrum, which was replaced by the much more limited Operation Triton (by the EU border agency, Frontex).
Operation Triton did not have a sufficiently broad search and rescue mandate, had fewer vessels and a significantly smaller area of operation. This contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of lives lost in the Mediterranean. As of 31 May 2015, 1,865 people had died attempting the Mediterranean crossing, compared to 425 during the same period in 2014 (according to the IOM).
Follow several horrific cases of loss of life in the Mediterranean, at the end of April, European leaders finally increased resources for search and rescue. Triton’s resources and area of operation were increased to match Mare Nostrum’s. In addition European states such as Germany, Ireland and the UK have deployed ships and aircrafts, additional to Operation Triton resources to further boost capacity for assisting people at sea. These measures, which had long been advocated for by Amnesty International, are a welcome step towards increasing safety at sea for refugees and migrants.
The European Commission also proposed that EU states offer 20,000 additional resettlement places to refugees from outside the EU. While this proposal is a step forward, 20,000 is too small a number to adequately contribute to international responsibility-sharing.
For example, Syrian refugees faced with reduced humanitarian assistance in the main host countries and with no prospect of returning home in the near future, are likely to continue to attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe. Without sufficient safe and legal alternative routes for refugees – but also for migrants – people will continue to risk their lives.
Africa: Forgotten crises There are more than three million refugees in sub-Saharan Africa. Outbreaks of fighting in countries including South Sudan and the Central African Republic (CAR), have led to an increasing number of people on the move – fleeing conflict and persecution. Of the top 10 countries globally from which people are fleeing as refugees, five are in are in sub-Saharan Africa. Four of the top ten refugee-hosting countries are in sub-Saharan Africa
The conflicts and crises in the region have led to an influx of refugees to neighbouring countries, many of which already host tens of thousands of long-standing refugee populations from countries such as Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia, among others.
In some of these situations, as in the case of South Sudan and Sudan, refugees are hosted by countries that are themselves beset by conflict.
The refugee crises in Africa receive little or no attention in regional or global political forums. In 2013 fewer than 15,000 refugees from African countries were resettled and UN humanitarian appeals have been severely underfunded. For example, as a result of the conflict which broke out in South Sudan in December 2013, more than 550,000 people became refugees, the majority of whom are now in Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Uganda. Only 11% of the UN’s South Sudan regional refugee response plan was funded as of 3 June 2015.
South East Asia: Turning away the desperate
In the first quarter of 2015, UNHCR reported that some 25,000 people attempted to cross the Bay of Bengal. This is approximately double the figure for the same period in 2014. This Bay of Bengal sea route is predominantly used by Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar and Bangladeshi nationals.
On 11 May, the International Organization for Migration estimated that there were 8,000 people stranded on boats close to Thailand. Many of those aboard were believed to be Rohingya fleeing state-sponsored persecution in Myanmar.
During May, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand turned back boats carrying hundreds of refugees and migrants desperate for help, despite the dangers they faced. UNHCR estimates that 300 people died at sea in the first three months of 2015 due to “starvation, dehydration and abuse by boat crews”.
On 20 May Indonesia and Malaysia changed course, announcing that they would provide “temporary shelter” for up to 7,000 people still at sea. However, this temporary protection would only last for up to a year, and on condition that the international community would help with repatriation or resettlement of the people. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have not ratified the UN Refugee Convention.
Elsewhere, a terrible precedent has been set in the region by the Australian government whose hard-line approach to asylum-seekers attempting to arrive by boat has, under the guise of saving lives, violated its responsibilities under refugee and human rights law.
“From the Andaman to the Mediterranean people are losing their lives as they desperately seek safe haven. The current refugee crisis will not be solved unless the international community recognizes that it is a global problem that requires states to significantly step up international cooperation. Later this week UNHCR will release their annual statistics on refugees and we will likely find that the crisis is getting worse. It is time for action,” said Salil Shetty.

		African Union should call on South Africa to protect refugees and migrants from xenophobic attacks
	","
		The African Union (AU) should call on the South African authorities to provide a long-term security guarantee for refugees, migrants and asylum seekers living in the country, Amnesty International and other 12 civil society organisations said today at a side event during the AU summit underway in Pretoria and Johannesburg.
The 25th Ordinary Session of the AU takes place against the backdrop of continuing xenophobic attacks against foreign nationals living in the country by locals.

	
	
		This is the moment for the AU to put pressure on the South African government to resolve the persistent occurrence of Xenophobia in the country and ensure there is no impunity for the perpetrators. The AU must remind the government of its obligation to protect everyone living in its territory from violent attacks, regardless of their status. Xenophobic attacks must end
	

		
			Noel Kututwa, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa Region.
		
The country has a long history of xenophobic attacks against asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. In 2008, 62 people were killed and hundreds of thousands others left displaced in a spate of xenophobic attacks in the country.

	
	
		In the same way that African leaders must hold each other to account for delivering on good governance and human rights, they are also accountable for protecting people within their borders. At this week’s African Union Summit, we are calling on the AU to help South Africa demonstrate its leadership in addressing xenophobia and protecting the rights of all, including refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers
	

		
			Sipho Mthathi, Oxfam South Africa’s Executive Director.
		
Since the beginning of 2015, the country saw a surge in targeted xenophobic violence against refugees, asylum-seekers, migrants and their businesses.
Tensions worsened in March following controversial statement made by the Zulu Monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini at a public function, saying that “immigrants must take their bags and go where they came from”.
There are at least five verified deaths of “foreign nationals” including of two Mozambicans, one Zimbabwean, one Ethiopian and one Bangladeshi. However there were reports of other deaths, which remain to be verified. Three South Africans also died in the violence.
“There have been a number of careless comments from people in authority regarding the status of foreign nationals targeted during the attacks. The AU must reiterate that the rights to life and not to be tortured or treated in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner are absolute. There can be no justification for violating these rights. The immigration status of foreign -nationals who are victims of the attacks in South Africa is therefore irrelevant.” said Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, Executive Director of SALC.
Following the March/April 2015 xenophobic attacks in South Africa, AU Commission Chairperson Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma condemned attacks on foreign nationals in KwaZulu Natal Province, describing the violence as “unacceptable”.
The Peace and Security Council of the AU at its meeting of 30 April 2015 condemned xenophobia in all its forms and manifestations and stated that the incidents were part of larger, social, economic and political challenges facing the continent.
In April 2015, The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights also adopted a resolution at its 56th Ordinary Session in Banjul, The Gambia condemning xenophobic attacks in South Africa.
Amnesty International and other civil society organizations are calling on the AU to stand by its commitment to promote and advance human rights and to end impunity in member states by publicly urging the government of South Africa to fully and effectively implement the Commission’s recommendations, in particular, to:
- Immediately end the attacks on foreign nationals in the country and put measures in place to ensure that it does not recur.
- Fully and transparently investigate the circumstances leading to the xenophobic attacks and other acts of violence perpetrated against foreign nationals.
- Ensure that all perpetrators of the attacks are brought to justice in accordance with the law.
- Take immediate steps to ratify and domesticate the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa as well as make a declaration under the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights that would allow direct access for individuals and Non-governmental Organisations to the Court.

		Amnesty International staff members expelled from Morocco
	","
		The expulsion of two Amnesty International experts from Morocco is a blatant attempt to prevent legitimate human rights research and muzzle criticism in the country, said Amnesty International.
Moroccan police held John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia and Irem Arf, Refugee and Migrant Rights Researcher, separately today. Both had their passports confiscated and were questioned at police stations in Rabat and Oujda, respectively, before they were put on separate flights to London and Paris.
“Morocco’s lofty words about being an open country have been exposed as hollow by their actions today,” said Anna Neistat, Amnesty International’s Senior Director for Research.

The Amnesty International team was expelled despite having informed authorities of their planned visit. Amnesty International has received written and verbal assurances, most recently in May in a meeting with Moroccan officials, that the organization could visit the country without being required to obtain prior authorization. They had arrived in Morocco on Monday for a fact-finding visit to investigate the situation of migrants and refugees at Morocco's northern borders with Spain.
Moroccan police stopped Irem Arf and her translator at around 11.40 in Oujda. Her passport was confiscated and she was held by police and questioned for hours including about whom she was intending to meet. She was then informed that she would have to leave the country. Around 14:00 she was driven to the airport where she remained under police observation until she was put on a flight departing to Paris.
John Dalhuisen was picked up in his hotel by police in the capital Rabat at around noon today. He was detained at a police station where he was questioned politely but for more than four hours. He received an expulsion order which gave as official grounds ‘a threat to public order’ and barred him from re-entering the country.
This is not the first time that Amnesty International’s work in Morocco has been hampered in recent months. In September 2014 the Moroccan authorities banned an Amnesty International youth camp, and denied entry to an Amnesty International fact-finding delegation the following month. A second fact-finding visit scheduled for November 2014 was cancelled by the organization after the Moroccan authorities sought to impose conditions on how it could operate.
Amnesty International was previously denied access to Morocco for three years, between 1990 and 1993. Since then the organization had not experienced any restrictions on visiting the country until October last year.
The relationship between the organization and Moroccan authorities deteriorated markedly after the launch of Amnesty International’s Stop Torture Campaign in 2014 which detailed Morocco’s continued use of torture.
“Moroccan authorities' attempts to thwart Amnesty International’s work in the country, and our ability to investigate alleged human rights abuses, takes place against a backdrop of growing restrictions on local human rights groups,” said Anna Neistat.
“Rather than expelling us, Moroccan authorities should show they have nothing to hide by granting human rights researchers unfettered access to those most vulnerable to abuse.”

		France: Fears over the fate of scores of forcibly evicted migrants in Paris
	","
		Up to 200 migrants and asylum seekers, many of whom have already been forcibly evicted in the past 10 days, are at risk of being removed once again from a park in northern Paris in the coming hours, leaving scores homeless, Amnesty International said.
“The French authorities cannot just keep moving these migrants and asylum seekers from pillar to post without seeking viable alternatives – the State has a duty to ensure durable accommodation solutions for all those who seek asylum,” said Marco Perolini, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Discrimination in Europe.

“Real and viable alternative solutions must be found to give these migrants and refugees adequate shelter and services, including access to asylum procedures.”
The migrants and asylum seekers have been sleeping at the Bois Dormoy Park near Gare du Nord train station. The association running the park has been hosting them but has said they must leave by 17:30 today. Municipal authorities have been working with two NGOs to agree on accommodation for a number of the migrants, but there are fears that scores could remain homeless.
Many of the migrants and asylum seekers now at Bois Dormoy Park, who mostly hail from Eritrea and Sudan, have been evicted by police from three other locations over the past 10 days.
Amnesty International has a delegation on the scene this evening and will be tweeting developments from @amnestypresse.

		EU moves towards closing search and rescue gap in the Mediterranean
	","
		The increase in Triton’s resources and operational area, confirmed by the European Commission (EC) today as it presented additional proposals around the European Agenda on Migration, will at last move towards closing the search and rescue gap created by the closure of Italy’s defunct Operation Mare Nostrum, enabling it to save more lives at sea, said Amnesty International.
“By adding resources to patrol the central Mediterranean and expanding the operational area of Triton to the level of the defunct Operation Mare Nostrum, the European Union has finally recognised the colossal mistake in closing Italy’s operation without replacing it with an equivalent mission,"" said Iverna McGowan, acting director of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office. 

	
	
		This means more assets at sea, closer to where most refugees and migrants, travelling on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, get into trouble and risk drowning. And ultimately more lives will be saved.

""In practice, this means more assets at sea, closer to where most refugees and migrants, travelling on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, get into trouble and risk drowning. And ultimately more lives will be saved.""
Whilst Amnesty International welcomed the significant increase in European search and rescue capacities, the reality is that lives will continue to be at risk. A truly comprehensive approach to migration will require more safe and legal routes to be offered to those seeking international protection. Without this, people will continue to embark on perilous journeys across the Mediterranean to Europe as a last resort.
One such measure that Amnesty International has been calling for is an increased number of resettlement places for refugees. Today the EC presented a proposal on resettlement in the context of the European Agenda on Migration. The proposal for a European Union (EU) wide resettlement scheme involving all member states, on top of existing national resettlement schemes, is a good idea. But the numbers proposed fall far short of what would be an adequate response to the global refugee crisis.
The EC also proposed an emergency scheme to support Italy and Greece through the relocation of 40,000 of the Syrian and Eritrean asylum-seekers arriving after 15 April in these countries to other EU member states over a two year period. Several practical considerations must be addressed to make sure that such plans guarantee the effective protection of vulnerable people.
 

	
	
		Any relocation proposals will only make a positive difference to the lives of those in need if reception conditions are improved, asylum systems are strengthened across the EU and the will of asylum-seekers is taken into consideration.

		Lampedusa's medic to the migrants
	","
		Dr Pietro Bartolo has seen more suffering and death in his career than any one man should have to witness.
As director of the small hospital on the Italian island of Lampedusa, the 59-year-old gynaecologist has for more than two decades overseen the emergency medical response to the incessant waves of migrants and refugees passing through the island in their attempt to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa.
Sitting in his office at the hospital, beneath a framed photo of an encounter he had with Pope Francis, he shared some of his experiences with a visiting Amnesty International delegation.

“I meet every single migrant and refugee who arrives in Lampedusa,” Bartolo said.
By his own estimate, this amounts to around 250,000 people in the past two decades.

			Dr Pietro Bartolo
		
He has spent thousands of nights at the island’s tiny port, awaiting boats overcrowded with those rescued at sea.
Medical workers promptly screen all new arrivals, to separate the sick and wounded from the healthy. This ensures that those most in need can get speedy access to medical care, while the relatively healthy are transported to Lampedusa’s reception centre, for shelter, warmth and a meal.
“People are wet, very cold and shivering, so we prefer to send them quickly to the centre where they can get a change of clothes,” he said.
The departed
Hundreds have arrived in body bags.
Bartolo told us about one fishing boat which arrived in Lampedusa after plucking 20 people out of the sea. Four people had already been placed in body bags near the fishing nets on the boat’s deck. Upon closer inspection, Bartolo saw that one of them was still alive:
“We took her out [of the body bag] and hurried to the hospital. We spent 30 minutes resuscitating her – her lungs were full of water and gasoline. After half an hour, her heart started beating again.”
She is now healthy and living in Sweden, he said.
“For me, even if it’s just that one, it’s worth it. Otherwise I have to do the job of the undertaker.”
However, the small glimmers of success are surpassed by overwhelming stories of suffering.
Bartolo recalled another woman who had been in labour when she crossed the sea in 2013. Neither she nor her baby survived the trip.
“They were found with the umbilical cord still attached. I put them in the same coffin; I didn’t even cut the umbilical cord. These are the very bad things that hurt you. People tell me: ‘you’re used to it’. But it’s not true, you don’t get used to it,” Bartolo said.

 Changing pathologies
Over the many years that Bartolo has been doing this work, changes in how people attempt the crossing have changed the type of injuries he and his staff have to treat.
In the 1990s, he said, migrants and refugees tended to arrive on much sturdier vessels that spent longer at sea, leading to lots of cases of dehydration.
In recent years however, there has been a shift. A much greater volume of people are now coming, but in smaller, less-seaworthy vessels. They often lack enough fuel for the trip and are simply given a satellite phone to send out a distress call when they run into trouble on the high seas.
Hypothermia is much more common now since people get sprayed with seawater as the flimsy boats get tossed about on the waves. Chemical burns are also rife, since petrol often spills inside the boats and clings to people’s clothes and skin. This results in serious injuries, including skin peeling off.
The bleakest moments
Bartolo has witnessed the aftermath of many sea tragedies, but some stick out in his mind as especially horrific. One is quite fresh in his memory: an incident on 17 April this year which he described simply as “disastrous.”
A boat had set sail from Libya at close to midnight with around 70 passengers, including 22 people with very serious burn injuries. Before they had set sail, a gas canister had caught fire and exploded in the place near Tripoli where they had been staying. Ten people died. In an act of appalling cruelty, the people in charge of the trip forced the other seriously injured migrants to board the boat, despite their clear need for medical assistance.
The following morning, the boat began to lose air and they phoned for help. Italy's Guardia di Finanza responded to the SOS call later that afternoon, bringing all 70, including the burn victims, to shore in Lampedusa. One of the injured women, around 20 years old, was declared dead on arrival.
After seeing the injuries, Bartolo knew there was no way that Lampedusa’s small hospital could cope with the emergency. Three ambulances made multiple trips to bring the injured to the hospital, and then he arranged for Italy’s Ministry of Defence to supply a fleet of helicopters to ensure all the victims were brought to hospitals in Sicily to receive the intensive care they needed.
Among the victims was a baby girl who had severe burns on her face and neck.
They also included an Eritrean woman who had fallen into a coma. She was flown to Sicily to be hospitalized. In the chaos, she had been separated from her two-year-old son, who was subsequently taken to Lampedusa's reception centre. It took almost a week for the various agencies involved to piece together what had happened and reunite mother and child.
Suffer the little children
The fate of the children rescued at sea seems to weigh heaviest on Bartolo.
Confronted with case after case of migrant and refugee children spending time in the hospital while their mothers undergo surgery or medical check-ups, hospital workers and the local community decided to create a special space for them.

    
  Workers at Lampedusa Hospital and the local community decided to create a special playroom for the migrant and refugee children who pass through the island.Ludoteca – “playroom” – is painted in bright colours on the door of a room near the operating theatre. Bartolo’s eyes lit up as he unlocked it and revealed what lies within.
Murals of brightly coloured animals, scenes from nature and letters of the alphabet adorn the walls. Four small tables have rainbow-coloured miniature seats for around 20 children to sit and play or watch videos. And donated toys are distributed about the room – Bartolo said there is a stockpile of fresh toys so that each migrant child can bring something with them when they leave.
It’s clear that this room is one of the few havens of solace left in Bartolo’s work life.
‘They continue to die’
However, Bartolo’s prognosis of the wider situation is not so optimistic.
When a devastating shipwreck happened several hundred metres off the coast of Lampedusa on 3 October 2013, resulting in 366 deaths, there were widespread calls for change.
But resistance to migration has meant it has been difficult for political leaders to agree on how best to save lives and create more safe and legal routes for migrants and refugees to reach Europe. Meanwhile the deaths on the high seas continue apace.
“Almost two years later, nothing has changed. They continue to arrive; they continue to die. So what have we fixed? Nothing,” Bartolo said, dejected.
“We do what we can, because it’s right to do it. We want to save as many lives as we can, but in the end it’s the system that’s broken.”
 

	
	
		We do what we can, because it’s right to do it. We want to save as many lives as we can, but in the end it’s the system that’s broken.
	

		
			Dr Bartolo
		
 
From the EU institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg to the UN Security Council in New York, there are currently moves under way to change this. It finally looks like European leaders are poised to up their game on collective search-and-rescue efforts in the Mediterranean.
But more will still die and Bartolo’s services will still be required – 3,500 people perished last year, even as Italy’s Operation Mare Nostrum saved tens of thousands of lives.
So long as Europe insists on building a fortress to keep out those fleeing misery, more people will drown in its moats. More needs to be done to provide safe, legal routes for refugees and migrants to make it to the continent without risking arriving in a body bag.

		Libya: Horrific abuse driving migrants to risk lives in Mediterranean crossings
	","
		Photo: © Reuters
Refugees and migrants across Libya face rape, torture and abductions for ransom by traffickers and smugglers, as well as systematic exploitation by their employers, religious persecution and other abuses by armed groups and criminal gangs, according to a new Amnesty International briefing published today.
‘Libya is full of cruelty’: Stories of abduction, sexual violence and abuse from migrants and refugees exposes the full horror and plight of refugees and migrants in Libya, many of whom are driven to risk their lives in treacherous sea crossings in a desperate attempt to reach sanctuary in Europe.
“The ghastly conditions for migrants, coupled with spiralling lawlessness and armed conflicts raging within the country, make clear just how dangerous life in Libya is today. With no legal avenues to escape and seek safety, they are forced to place their lives in the hands of smugglers who callously extort, abuse and attack them,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Director.
“The international community has stood and watched as Libya has descended into chaos since the 2011 NATO military campaign ended, effectively allowing militias and armed groups to run amok. World leaders have a responsibility and must be prepared to face the consequences, which include greater levels of refugees and migrants fleeing conflict and rampant abuse in Libya. Asylum-seekers and migrants are among the most vulnerable people in Libya and their plight must not be ignored.”

			Philip Luther, Amnesty International Director for the Middle East and North Africa
		
For years Libya has been both a destination and a transit country for refugees and migrants fleeing poverty, conflict or persecution in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Many come to Libya hoping to reach Europe. But the rise of lawlessness and threat posed by armed groups has exacerbated the risks they face, leading even established communities of migrants who have been living and working in Libya for years to flee to Europe by boat. Abuses in immigration detention centres where thousands of migrants and refugees, including children, face indefinite detention in deplorable conditions are another reason why so many are trying to leave.
With fewer viable routes overland to reach sanctuary in Europe, Syrian refugees are also among those travelling to Libya to attempt dangerous sea crossings towards European shores.
At a special summit held in Brussels last month, the European Council announced plans to increase resources for search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean.
“The commitment made by EU leaders to deploy more resources for search and rescue is a welcome step, but more people will continue to drown in the Mediterranean Sea unless rescue vessels are delivered promptly, deployed in areas where they are needed most – where most calls for help come from - and remain available for as long as high numbers of refugees and migrants continue to depart from Libya,” said Philip Luther.
The European Council also announced plans to intensify efforts to identify, capture and destroy vessels before they are used by smugglers. These measures are likely to be discussed at today’s meeting between the EU Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini and the UN Security Council. If implemented, the measures could lead to thousands of migrants and refugees being trapped in a conflict zone.

“Introducing measures to tackle smugglers without providing safe alternative routes out for the people desperate to flee conflict in Libya, will not resolve the plight of migrants and refugees,” said Philip Luther.
Egypt and Tunisia have also tightened border restrictions fearing a spillover of the conflict in Libya, leaving migrants and refugees whose passports have often been stolen or confiscated by smugglers, criminal gangs or their Libyan employers with no other feasible route out of the country except to embark on a perilous sea journey to Europe.
“The world cannot continue to ignore its obligation to grant sanctuary to anyone fleeing such dreadful abuse. Neighbouring countries, including Tunisia and Egypt, must keep their borders open to ensure anyone fleeing violence and persecution in Libya is granted safe refuge,” said Philip Luther.
Amnesty International is also calling for wealthy countries to increase the number of resettlement places for vulnerable refugees and for the international community to take effective steps to urgently address human rights abuses and serious violations of international humanitarian law being committed by all sides in Libya.
Religious persecution
Christian migrants and refugees in Libya are at particular risk of abuse from armed groups aiming to impose their own interpretation of Islamic law. People from Nigeria, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Egypt have been abducted, tortured, unlawfully killed and harassed because of their religion. Most recently a total of at least 49 Christians, mostly from Egypt and Ethiopia were beheaded and shot in three mass summary killings claimed by the group calling itself the Islamic State (IS).
Migrants and refugees also face widespread abductions, torture, theft and physical assaults by criminal gangs and human smugglers, often at Libya’s southern borders and along the smuggling routes to the Libyan coast.
Charles, a 30-year-old man from Nigeria, told Amnesty International he decided to flee to Europe by boat last month after he was abducted and physically assaulted a number of times by members of a criminal gang in the coastal city of Zuwara. He had gone there to escape indiscriminate shelling and fighting in Tripoli.
“They would come steal our money and flog us. I can’t complain to the police about the Christian issue because they don’t like us… In October 2014 four men kidnapped me… because they saw I was carrying a bible,” he said.
They took away his money and phone, and held him for two days while they tortured and beat him until he finally managed to escape one night through the window.
“Such horror stories about the dangers driving migrants and refugees to flee Libya highlight the continuing desperate need to save lives in the Mediterranean. European leaders must ensure that refugees and migrants fleeing conflict and human rights abuses are never pushed back to Libya,” said Philip Luther.

Abuses along the smuggling routes: abduction, extortion and sexual violence
Migrants and refugees face abuses at all stages of the smuggling routes from west and east Africa towards the Libyan coast.Sub-Saharan migrants and refugees, including unaccompanied children, have been abducted for ransom along the smuggling routes running towards the Libyan coast. During their captivity, they are subjected to torture and other ill-treatment to coerce them and their family members to pay a ransom. Those who are unable to pay are exploited and often held effectively as slaves - forced to work without pay, physically assaulted and robbed.
Smugglers also sometimes pass the migrants and refugees on to criminal groups once they cross the border in desert areas or in major transit cities along the migration route such as Sabha in the south-west or the coastal city of Ajdabya in eastern Libya.Migrants and refugees interviewed by Amnesty International said smugglers saw them “as slaves” and treated them “like animals”.
One said the smugglers kept them in a dirty overcrowded room with no toilet, blankets or mattresses and fed them only dried morsels of bread.
“It is effectively a business that they are running. They detain you so that you have to pay… If you don’t answer their questions, they beat you…with rubber pipes,” one man said.
Women, particularly those travelling alone or without men, are at serious risk of rape or sexual abuse by smugglers and criminal gangs. Women abducted along the smuggling route who are unable to pay the ransom are at times coerced into sex in exchange for being released or being allowed to continue their journey.
“I know that [the smuggler] used three Eritrean women. He raped them and they were crying. It happened at least twice,” one eyewitness told Amnesty International.
Another woman from Nigeria described how she was gang-raped by 11 men from an armed gang as soon as she arrived in Sabha.
“They took us to a place outside the city in the desert, tied my husband’s hands and legs to a pole and gang-raped me in front of his eyes. There were 11 men in total,” she said.

Abuses by smugglers before boat departures 
Some migrants and refugees said they were ill-treated by smugglers while held in partly constructed houses in Libya for periods of up to three months waiting for more passengers to be gathered. They said smugglers withheld food and water and beat them with sticks or stole their possessions.
Other Syrian refugees said they were transported in poorly ventilated refrigerator trucks. “Two children were starting to suffocate and stopped breathing. Their parents would slap them on their faces so they would wake up. We were banging on the walls but the driver would not stop,” they said. The children were later resuscitated.
Abuses at immigration detention centres in Libya
Migrants and refugees in Libya also face indefinite detention at immigration detention centres in dire conditions where they face rampant torture and other ill-treatment. Most are detained for irregular entry and similar offences. Those captured on boats that are intercepted by the Libyan coastguard while making the journey to Europe are also detained at such centres.
Women held in these centres have also reported sexual harassment and sexual violence. One woman told Amnesty International how officials at an immigration centre beat to death a pregnant woman detained in one such centre.
“They used to beat us with pipes on the back of our thighs; they even beat the pregnant women. At night they would come to our rooms and tried to sleep with us. Some of the women were raped. One woman got pregnant… This is why I decided to go to Europe. I suffered too much in prison,” one witness said.
“The Libyan authorities must immediately end their policy of systematic detention of refugees and migrants based solely on their immigration status, and ensure that individuals are only detained when strictly necessary for the shortest possible period,” said Philip Luther.

		Lampedusa: L'Isola Bella's shadow of death

By Conor Fortune, News Writer at Amnesty International
The sea glistened in the dusk half-light as our propeller plane buzzed in a wide arc above Palermo bay. Stark promontory drops along the craggy coastline of northern Sicily gave the scene a certain majesty.
But the apparent serenity masks a bleak human tragedy that has been unfolding in the central Mediterranean. The waters between Sicily and North Africa have already claimed around 1,700 lives this year, as the epicentre of Europe’s growing migrant and refugee crisis.
‘L’Isola bella’
When we landed in Lampedusa, 190 miles to the south, we should have seen locals busily preparing for the summer holiday season. After all, the tiny island has many assets – the people are friendly; the locally caught seafood is plentiful; the beaches are unspoilt and uncrowded.
“L’Isola Bella”, boasts a sign above the tourist office on a main pedestrian street in the town’s centre. The beautiful island.

    
  “L’Isola Bella” - the beautiful island - boasts a sign above the tourist office on a main pedestrian street in Lampedusa's centre. © Amnesty InternationalBut locals told us they worry that this beauty has been tainted by the lingering shadow of death. Journalists throng the island and the newspapers and airwaves are saturated by stories and analysis about the latest migrant tragedy at sea.
Given Lampedusa’s location – around 70 nautical miles from Tunisia, between Libya and the Italian mainland – it sits astride Europe’s busiest sea migration route.
People fleeing armed conflict, persecution and other hardship in sub-Saharan Africa, Syria, Palestine, and elsewhere are in ever greater numbers entrusting their lives to ruthless people-smugglers in an attempt to reach Europe.
In 2014, more than 170,000 people arrived on Italy’s shores. The same year, around 3,500 died – from drowning, hypothermia and other causes – or disappeared at sea, making this the world’s deadliest sea crossing.
The first few months of 2015 have seen a 100-fold increase in deaths at sea, compared to the same period last year.
All indications are that the number attempting to reach Europe will continue to rise. And unless more is done to bolster search-and-rescue, so will the death toll, turning the Mediterranean into a mass grave.
According to Lampedusa’s mayor Giusi Nicolini, fears about this spiralling death toll have scared off tourists, a key driver of the local economy.
She says the islanders are getting fed up of the bad press and European leaders’ failure to take adequate action to stem the crisis.

	
	
		We have to govern this process rather than letting shipwrecks use natural selection to decide who arrives and who doesn’t. It is unacceptable to condemn people to die at sea just because they are black.
	

		
			Giusi Nicolini, Mayor of Lampedusa
		
“We have to govern this process rather than letting shipwrecks use natural selection to decide who arrives and who doesn’t,” Nicolini told us. “It is unacceptable to condemn people to die at sea just because they are black.”
Mare Nostrum
Last year’s death toll would likely have been much higher if not for Mare Nostrum – a search-and-rescue operation set up by the Italian Navy in October 2013.
It was Italy’s response to what was, at that time, the country’s deadliest shipwreck, a few hundred metres off Lampedusa’s coast.
The boat in that game-changing tragedy caught fire and sank with more than 500 migrants aboard, mainly Eritreans and Somalis.
The images of dead bodies floating in the water and the spectre of hundreds of lives at risk sparked a global outcry. Everyone from the UN Refugee Agency to the European Commission to the Vatican called for urgent action to prevent similar tragedies in the future.
The Italian Government responded: within 15 days the Italian Navy deployed within its Operation Mare Nostrum – “our sea” – to assist boats in distress and to combat people-smuggling and trafficking.
Under Mare Nostrum, five Italian Navy ships were ready to act at any time, supported by air units and around 900 staff. Its operational area reached up to 100 nautical miles south of Lampedusa, placing help closer to the area off Libya’s coast where most of the shipwrecks take place.
This push to save more lives worked. Over the course of the next year, Mare Nostrum helped to rescue more than 166,000 people, amid a massive surge in those making the perilous sea crossing.
But around Europe, some raised eyebrows at such unilateral efforts, arguing they were encouraging people to cross. Meanwhile in Italy, others complained that the country should not have to bear Mare Nostrum's cost alone. It was phased out towards the end of 2014 and replaced by Triton, a pan-Europe border control operation with a mandate to work within 30 nautical miles of Italy’s coastline. People kept coming, despite the bad weather and the closure of Mare Nostrum – which entailed a drastic scaling back of search-and-rescue capacity in the central Mediterranean, with catastrophic results.
Deadly shipwrecks and incidents at sea have become ever more commonplace since Mare Nostrum ended. In a single horrific event on 20 April, around 820 migrants and refugees are believed to have died when a trawler capsized and sank. The UN Refugee Agency said it was the deadliest incident it had ever recorded in the Mediterranean.
Lampedusa’s coast guard station still responds valiantly to distress calls. They are “sempre presente” to save lives, the commander, Capitano di Corvetta Salvatore di Grande, told us.
But all they have at their disposal are four small search-and-rescue boats moored in Lampedusa’s harbour. These each comfortably fit around 40-50 people on board, though they’ve had to cram in up to 110 in cases of emergency.

The crisis far outstrips their ability to respond. On a recent weekend, they received 20 separate SOS calls. Passing merchant vessels – which are not equipped for search-and-rescue operations – are increasingly being relied on to fill the gaps left by Mare Nostrum’s demise.
The survivors
The surge in refugees and migrants seeking protection and a decent life in Europe has brought a constant flow of people through Lampedusa.
When we visited the reception centre for migrants and refugees late last week, there were 263 people inside.
A social worker at the centre told us that, just days before, there had been more than 1,400 rescued migrants and refugees crammed into this small facility, designed to house only around 380 for short periods before they are taken to larger centres around Sicily. It was so overcrowded that many people had to sleep in the open air. A stack of mattresses still piled up to the roof in a back corner of the centre was testament to this.

Those we saw inside the centre came from many countries – Nigeria, Somalia, Eritrea, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Guinea, Senegal. During our visit, a group of teenage boys started an impromptu football match in the courtyard, using water bottles and rocks as goalposts. Many shouted in French or their national languages. Small conflicts erupted, and then dissipated, over perceived fouls.
Groups of boys and men and a small number of women sat on the side-lines, watching or staring into oblivion. A small Eritrean child no older than four played with a social worker. He laughed and scribbled on my notepad but didn’t utter a word. It was unclear if there was anyone there who would understand him.
Some bystanders chatted freely with us when we approached. Others seemed aloof, detached, and traumatized by their ordeal. A social worker told our team that two women in particular should be left alone.
Ali, a 15-year-old boy from Somalia, shared his story. Orphaned at a young age amid his country’s conflict, he decided to set out for Europe in a journey funded by a friend’s father. He explained how, in a three-month odyssey, he crossed the Sahara with people-smugglers, had to bury his friend in the desert, witnessed a gory explosion in Libya, and then got trapped in an unseaworthy boat on the high seas.
It took six hours for help to arrive after his small boat started leaking air. He described it as “the worst moment of my life”. More than 70 people were crammed into the doomed vessel, including 22 with serious burn injuries.

Restart the rescue
Perhaps the most incredible thing about the exponential rise in deaths in the central Mediterranean is how easy it would be for Europe to halt it.
“It took us little more than a weekend to organize [Mare Nostrum]. The Italian Navy stands ready,” Navy Commander Massimiliano Lauretti previously told Amnesty International. “We have well-rehearsed procedures. We have built our experience. If we are asked, we can re-start a humanitarian operation in …48-72 hours.”
What’s lacking is political will. Last month's emergency summit in Brussels to try to tackle the Mediterranean crisis only met the problem halfway.
Funds for Operation Triton are now to be tripled, but the fact remains that this will not address the search-and-rescue needs in the central Mediterranean, particularly because Triton is currently deploying assets too close to Europe’s shores. What’s needed is a humanitarian operation to patrol the high seas mid-way between Lampedusa and Libya, where most of the deaths occur.
The indifferent sea
Once again airborne and leaving Lampedusa behind us for now, a grey mist quickly shrouded the scrubland around the tiny airport. Propellers whirling, we pulled up and away, and the view below was soon engulfed by opaque blue on all sides.
It was hard not to think how this vast sea’s indifference to the human tragedy it hosts is not all that far removed from European political leaders’ callous indifference to the suffering they have it in their power to stop.

The death of upwards of 1,000 refugees and migrants this week alone in the Mediterranean has prompted the European Commission and European foreign and interior ministers to finally acknowledge the need to urgently address search and rescue failures, said Amnesty International today following an announcement at an urgently convened meeting in Luxembourg.
While this marks a positive break from the previous policy of denial and empty rhetoric, the organization warns that the devil will be in the detail. The full scope of the area of operations, the resources and assets made available for search and rescue and by when will be crucial in determining whether lives will be saved.
“Thursday’s emergency summit will be the litmus test for Europe’s commitment to save lives in the Mediterranean. Words must now turn into concrete action specifically in the form of a European multi-nation and robust search and rescue operation,” said Iverna McGowan acting Director, Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office.
“Finally a sense of urgency has mobilized European governments and EU institutions to act - at least on paper. This can no longer be rhetoric. It is now up to Europe to urgently follow through on their commitments by concretely delivering a comprehensive search and rescue flotilla with accompanying air support operating where needed. This alone will reduce the death-toll,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia.
Amnesty International will release a briefing Europe’s sinking shame: The failure to save refugees and migrants at sea, at 12.00pm BST on 22 April.

		As many as 900 feared dead so far this year, according to UN Refugee Agency
Almost 10,000 rescued since the weekend, according to Italian coastguard
European governments have failed to address the humanitarian crisis
New Amnesty International report due out later this month
European governments’ ongoing negligence towards the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean has contributed to a more than 50-fold increase in migrant and refugee deaths since the beginning of 2015, Amnesty International said today amid fears that as many as 400 more have died amid rescue missions off the coast of Libya in recent days.
The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) today said it was “deeply shocked” that this latest tragedy could bring the death toll to almost 900 people since 1 January 2015, compared to 17 during the same period in 2014. This is almost 53 times as many migrant and refugee deaths.
On 28 April, Amnesty International will launch a new report which offers an in-depth analysis of the current crisis and includes direct testimonies of survivors of shipwrecks during the first three months of 2015. It details how current search-and-rescue operations are a far cry from what is needed to address the humanitarian crisis in the central Mediterranean.

	
	
		How many more people have to die before European governments acknowledge that relying on a patchwork quilt of resources for search-and-rescue operations is not enough?
	

		
			Gauri Van Gulik, Deputy Europe and Central Asia Programme Director at Amnesty International
		
“How many more people have to die before European governments acknowledge that relying on a patchwork quilt of resources for search-and-rescue operations is not enough?” said Gauri Van Gulik, Deputy Europe and Central Asia Programme Director at Amnesty International.
“Thousands of desperate migrants and refugees continue to make the world’s most dangerous sea crossing, and hundreds have already died this year – a massive increase over the same period in 2014.”
All indications point to a continued rise in the number of migrants and refugees making this trip as the weather improves, violence and persecution continue in countries like Syria and Eritrea, and instability persists in Libya, the launching point for the majority of the people-smuggling voyages across the Mediterranean.
In the latest string of tragedies, the Italian coastguard told Amnesty International it had rescued a total of almost 10,000 people when it responded to dozens of separate SOS calls since Saturday 11 April. On Sunday 12 April, the Italian coast guard retrieved nine corpses from one wooden boat which had capsized, and search efforts are ongoing as hundreds more from that boat are feared missing.
As in other recent search-and-rescue operations, the Italian coastguard had to rely on ad hoc assistance from a combination of the European Union’s “Triton” border-control operation and any nearby merchant vessels.
“Europe has scaled back search-and-rescue capacity based on the flawed argument that such operations were acting as a ‘pull factor’, attracting more migrants. But the reality in the Mediterranean is exposing that fallacy, since the numbers of desperate people seeking to make it to Europe are only going up,” said Gauri Van Gulik.

	
	
		Leaders in London, Paris, Berlin and other European capitals must admit that the current strategy isn’t working and throw their full weight behind a robust and concerted humanitarian operation in the Mediterranean, with at least the same resources as the Italian Mare Nostrum operation which was shut down last year.

		South Africa: Urgently take steps to combat impunity for xenophobic violence

South African authorities will need to do much more if impunity for xenophobic violence and other relating longstanding human rights violations are to be effectively combatted, Amnesty International-South Africa has said today. Widespread attacks against refugees, migrants and their businesses most recently in the Durban area have finally triggered some action from government officials.
In the past two weeks, at least four people have been killed, many others seriously injured, shops looted and over 1,000 people displaced in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal province.

	
	
		We acknowledge that the police are conducting arrests. However the authorities must launch full, transparent and independent investigations, and bring suspected perpetrators to account

“We acknowledge that the police are conducting arrests. However the authorities must launch full, transparent and independent investigations, and bring suspected perpetrators to account,” said Sicel’mpilo Shange-Buthane, Executive Director of Amnesty International-South Africa.
“The prevailing culture of impunity must be stopped.”
Amnesty International has repeatedly appealed to the South African government, including in January this year, to develop a systematic plan involving the police and other agencies to prevent and protect refugees from targeted attacks.
The blatant attacks, which have included violence against journalists covering incidents and against some police intervening, follow months of similar violence in other provinces of South Africa, including in Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces.
On 13 April 2015, the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal province, Senzo Mchunu, established a task team of experts, under the leadership of the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, to investigate the causes of the violence in the province.
The violence against refugees is unusual in KwaZulu-Natal and appears to have been triggered by the reported statement of the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, that government must take steps so that all foreigners” leave South Africa. 
On 13 April 2015, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe reportedly stated that there was a need for camps in response to the attacks against refugees.
“In our view, this turns the problem on its head, undermines South Africa’s integration model for refugee protection and may inadvertently encourage further attacks against them.”
After repeated calls from civil society, Amnesty International and humanitarian agencies for the appointment of an inter-ministerial committee to address the continuing crisis, President Jacob Zuma condemned the violence and sent a high-level delegation to work with the provincial government to address the situation on 12 April 2015. The members of the delegation include the ministers of Home Affairs, State Security and the Police.
Local government authorities also bear a responsibility to address tensions and threats rapidly as they emerge. Ultimately all levels of government bear a responsibility to fulfill South Africa’s obligation to ensure the constitutional right for all “to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources”, without discrimination.

		Tajikistani dissenters at grave risk after an opposition leader shot dead in Turkey

Associates of Umarali Kuvvatov, a founding member of a Tajikistan opposition group, are at grave risk of further attacks after he was shot dead in Istanbul last night, Amnesty International said today.
Umarali Kuvvatov and his family previously told the organization he had received threats, as well as tips from sympathizers that there had been “orders” to harm them, allegedly coming from the highest levels of Tajikistan’s authorities.

	
	
		Umarali Kuvvatov’s killing sends a chilling and extreme message to Tajikistani political dissenters both at home and abroad.
	

		
			Denis Krivosheev, Deputy Europe and Central Asia Director at Amnesty International
		
“Umarali Kuvvatov’s killing sends a chilling and extreme message to Tajikistani political dissenters both at home and abroad. The Turkish authorities must lead an impartial, effective and prompt investigation into his unlawful killing, reveal the full truth and bring the perpetrators to justice,” said Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Europe and Central Asia Programme Director.
“We have received reports of death threats and attempted assassinations of dissenters from Tajikistan in foreign countries in recent years, but this is the first actual killing of a Tajikistani political activist. It begs the immediate question: how many more are at risk?”
In recent years other high-profile persons fleeing persecution have been killed in Turkey, allegedly by foreign operatives. The victims have included former Chechen insurgents and an Uzbekistan-born imam who was critical of the Uzbek government.
“The Turkish authorities must ensure safety for all persons fleeing persecution, from Tajikistan and other countries,” said Denis Krivosheev.
“There are also Tajik refugees elsewhere, including in Russia, where political and religious dissenters have long faced serious risk of abduction and forcible return to Tajikistan.”
The human rights situation in Tajikistan has further deteriorated in recent months, with the rights to freedom of expression and association under attack, particularly in the run-up to the parliamentary elections, held last Sunday, with little room left for political or other dissent.
Umarali Kuvvatov – along with other Tajikistani business leaders, opposition politicians and activists – was one of the founders of “Group 24”, which has publicly criticized the widespread corruption under Tajikistan’s President Rahmon. In Tajikistan he faced charges of “economic crimes” and “extremism”, which appear to be politically motivated.
In October 2014 Tajikistan’s Supreme Court pronounced “Group 24” an “extremist” organization and banned all its activities in Tajikistan. The Tajikistan authorities also stated that a number of suspected “Group 24” members had been added to an international wanted list for “the attempt to overthrow a government” and “extremism”.
Forced returns to Tajikistan
Tajikistani political dissenters and those accused of religious “extremism” have also been abducted and forcibly returned from several former Soviet countries.
Amnesty International has numerous cases of security services in Russia and the Central Asian republics colluding in the abduction, disappearance, unlawful transfer, imprisonment and torture of individuals wanted on religious, political and economic grounds. The frequency of these human rights violations amounted to a region-wide renditions programme.
An example is Maksud Ibragimov, the head of political movement “Youth for Tajikistan Revival”, who was detained briefly by Russian police last October after being put on Tajikistan’s wanted list. He was released the same day by orders of the Prosecutor’s Office on the grounds that a Russian citizen cannot be handed over to another state. In November 2014, two unidentified assailants stabbed and shot at him in Moscow, but he survived.
According to Maksud Ibragimov’s family, on 20 January 2015 he was taken from his flat in Moscow to an unknown location by five men claiming to be officers from the Federal Migration Service. On 30 January members of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Tajikistan told the media that Maksud Ibragimov was being held in pre-trial detention in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan, on charges of “extremism”. His family in Moscow had learnt that his Russian citizenship had been revoked.

	
	
		The recent cases of Umarali Kuvvatov and Maksud Ibragimov add to a growing list of Tajik opposition members who have faced violence, harassment and even death when they sought a safe haven abroad.

		Latest Mediterranean tragedy exposes EU’s failure on rescue operations

The deaths of at least 10 more refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean expose how European governments are still failing to provide adequate resources for a coordinated search-and-rescue operation that would save countless lives, Amnesty International said today.
 

	
	
		Merchant vessels and national coastguards have again responded valiantly to the immense and growing challenge of saving the lives of vulnerable migrants, refugees and asylum seekers off Europe’s southern shores. But that’s far from enough in the face of this growing humanitarian crisis. Without a European search-and-rescue operation, the European Union’s approach looks increasingly haphazard and negligent.

Almost 1,000 refugees and migrants in distress
Within a 24-hour period on 3 March, eight separate ad-hoc search-and-rescue operations in the Strait of Sicily saved at least 941 migrants. In one incident a boat capsized when the refugees, who according to the Italian coast guard included many Syrians, saw a towboat in the distance and bunched together on one side of the boat. Although 121 people were rescued from this boat, 10 corpses were retrieved.
The most recent SOS calls came from around 50 nautical miles (92km) north of Libya, far beyond the waters patrolled by the European Union (EU) Triton border management operation. Merchant vessels, as well as the Italian and Tunisian coast guards responded to the distress calls. One Triton vessel was also involved to bolster national efforts.
EU ‘sense of urgency’
At a press briefing today in Brussels, the European Commission stated that the EU needs a collective “sense of urgency” about its response to migration to Europe. A new European Agenda on Migration, set for release in mid-May, will include the increase of safe and legal migration routes to Europe. But it is not expected to pave the way for a coordinated search-and-rescue mission to respond to the growing numbers of deaths at sea.
Amnesty International has repeatedly called for an EU-wide search-and-rescue mission with at least the same mandate and resources as Italy’s Mare Nostrum operation, which saved more than 170,000 lives before it was shut down late last year.

	
	
		Today the European Commission publicly recognised that Triton was not a replacement for Italy’s Mare Nostrum. Surely a sense of urgency should include pulling out all the stops to fill the gap left by the closure of this vital search-and-rescue mission.
	

		
			Iverna McGowan, acting director of Amnesty International European Institutions Office
		
Other international bodies have echoed this call. In a press release issued ahead of a key meeting of the UN’s International Maritime Organization in London today, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), called on EU member states to “act urgently to prevent the loss of thousands more lives”.

		European Commission’s announcement on migration: Right words, but no solutions
	","
		Today’s announcement by the European Commission on managing the migration crisis in the Mediterranean contains the right analysis of the overall situation, but offers no concrete solutions to protecting and saving lives, said Amnesty International.
“We agree that a European solution to the search and rescue crisis is urgently needed, but that's not being offered here. Member states need to step up and chip in. Extending operation Triton without increasing its assets and operational area changes absolutely nothing,” said Iverna McGowan, acting director of Amnesty International European Institutions Office.
During a press briefing in Brussels, Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, acknowledged that the European Union (EU) needed to react more efficiently to the “ever starker” reality of the rising number of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean.
While he pledged to extend Triton, a pan-EU border management operation, to the end of the year and announced €13 million in new emergency funding to help Italy with the reception of rescued migrants, he did not commit to bolstering search and rescue operations. Before its closure at the end of last year, Italy’s Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation saved thousands of lives, with a price tag of €9.5 million per month. The significantly smaller Operation Triton costs between €1.5 and €2.9 million a month.
Despite Mare Nostrum’s closure, Italy’s coast guard has continued to lead on life-saving operations in the central Mediterranean – contributing to the rescue of more than 2,800 people last weekend alone, including the deployment of Frontex assets. The loss of more than 300 lives earlier this month near the Italian island of Lampedusa underscored the glaring gap in search-and-rescue resources.
“The latest Lampedusa tragedy laid bare yet again the woeful inadequacy of the European Union’s current border control approach to the spiralling humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean. Today’s announcement has failed to change the simple fact that without more resources from member states for search and rescue, more people will die on the high seas,” said John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia Programme Director at Amnesty International.

		Italy: Lampedusa survivors' tales of despair should shock EU into action
	","
		The European Union’s limited search and rescue resources contributed to the soaring death toll after four rubber dinghies carrying hundreds of migrants sent out an SOS in stormy weather in the southern Mediterranean last week, Amnesty International revealed today after a visit to Lampedusa.
Following the tragedy that claimed more than 300 lives, an Amnesty International research team carried out interviews, in Rome and Lampedusa, with survivors, members of the Italian coastguard and local authorities.
When the distress call came in on Sunday 8 February, the main vessel used in the pan-EU border management operation Triton was docked hundreds of kilometres away in Malta for maintenance. The large military vessels used in Italy’s now-defunct Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation were also out of use and docked even farther away in Sicily.
“Italian coast guard officials responded admirably and with exceptional personal courage to the SOS call, putting in long hours amid incredibly treacherous conditions at sea. It’s impossible to know how many lives they could have saved with better resources, but the death toll would likely be lower,” said Matteo de Bellis, Amnesty International’s Italy Campaigner, who just returned from Lampedusa.
""Unless the void of Italy’s now defunct lifesaving Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation is filled, refugees and migrants will continue to die in great numbers at sea.""

Departures of refugees and migrants surged over the weekend, and will continue to do so as Libya descends deeper into violence. The Italian coast guard confirmed that Italian authorities and merchant vessels rescued a total of more than 2,800 people in at least 18 boats between Friday 13 and Sunday 15 February. On Sunday 15 February alone, 2,225 people were rescued from a dozen boats.
This comes just a week after at least 300 deaths at sea as four other boats attempted the crossing from Libya to Italy in stormy weather. Amnesty International spoke to some of the survivors of that tragedy.
Departure from Libya
According to survivors’ testimonies, 400 migrants in all, most of them young men from West Africa, were attempting to travel across the Mediterranean in four boats from Libya when they ran into trouble last Sunday, 8 February.
People smugglers had kept them near Tripoli to await the journey after charging them the equivalent of around 650 euros. On the evening of Saturday 7 February, the armed people smugglers brought the migrants to the Libyan port town of Garabouli, 40 km west of Tripoli, and made them board four inflatable dinghies.
Early the next day, as the boats drifted in the Mediterranean Sea north of Libya, it was clear that they were in serious danger.
SOS call
Italian coast guard officials told Amnesty International they received a satellite phone call for help early in the afternoon on 8 February, from a location 120 nautical miles (222 km) south of Lampedusa and 40 nautical miles (74 km) north of Libya. The call was mostly unintelligible but the officials could make out the words “dangerous, dangerous” in English.
Coast guard officials stressed that, under the circumstances, the migrants were sailing to their almost certain death. The weather forecast in that part of the Mediterranean was bad for the entire week. The boats were powered by small outboard motors, and the people smugglers apparently had not provided enough petrol for the trip.
According to survivor accounts, more than 300 people perished. The migrants, many of whom were scantily clothed, were exposed to extreme weather conditions for up to two days, including near-freezing temperatures, rain and even hail as their boats were at times tossed about on waves of up to eight metres.
Italian coast guard responders managed to rescue 105 people from one dinghy at 9pm on Sunday, but 29 of those died of hypothermia and other causes after the rescue. Two merchant vessels in the area rescued nine remaining survivors from two other boats. Survivors confirmed that there were four dinghies in total, which were numbered 1-4. One boat is still missing.

	
	
		The boat started to lose air and to fill with water. People began to fall into the sea. At each wave, two or three were taken away.
	

		
			Ibrahim, a 24-year-old man from Mali who was one of only two survivors in his dinghy
		
Amnesty International spoke to Ibrahim, a 24-year-old man from Mali who was one of only two survivors in his dinghy:
“[At around 7pm on] Sunday the boat started to lose air and to fill with water. People began to fall into the sea. At each wave, two or three were taken away. The front part of the boat rose, so people on the back fell in the sea. At that point, only about 30 people remained on the boat. One side of the boat … stayed afloat …and [we clung to a rope as we had] water up to our belly. [Eventually] only four of us remained. We kept holding on, together, all night. It was raining. At sunrise, two slipped away. During the morning we saw a helicopter. There was a red shirt in the water; I shook it so they would see me. They threw a small inflatable boat, but I didn’t have the energy to reach it. So we stayed, holding on. Half an hour later, a cargo boat arrived. It threw a rope to get us onboard. It was about 3 in the afternoon [on 9 February].”
Lamin, also from Mali, was on board the other dinghy approached by a merchant vessel:
“We were 107 [on board]. In the high seas, the waves were taking the boat up and down. Everyone was afraid. I saw three people falling in the water. No one could help. They tried to catch the boat but couldn’t. Then many others died, maybe for lack of food or water. I can’t count how many died. When a big, commercial boat came to rescue us, only seven of us were [left]. The rescuers threw a rope and got us onboard. During the rescue, [our] boat folded in two and went down, taking down all the bodies.”
Rescue operation
The Italian coast guard responded to the SOS call on 8 February by sending a search aircraft and four patrol boats – two of them were dispatched immediately, followed by two more after one of the initial boats had an engine problem.
The head of the Italian coast guard’s rescue operation centre was frank about the limited resources at their disposal:
“Can you imagine what it means to cover that distance in an 18-metre boat with waves as high as eight or nine metres? We feared for the lives of our crew… When departures pick up after the winter, we won’t be able to take them all, if we remain the only one to go out there.”

Amnesty International is urging EU countries to provide collective and concerted search and rescue operations along routes taken by migrants, to at least the same level as Mare Nostrum. In the meantime, the organization is urging Italy to provide additional emergency resources until this happens.
Background
Many of those rescued after last week’s tragedy are from Côte d’Ivoire (41 – including two children) followed by Mali (23, including a child), Senegal (nine), Guinea (seven), Gambia (two) and Niger (two). Ivorians also reportedly account for more than half of the confirmed fatalities among those rescued – 15 out of the 29, along with seven men from Mali, five Senegalese and one each from Guinea and Mauritania.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it expects the trend of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to continue in 2015. Some 218,000 crossed in 2014, and the numbers for January 2015 already show a 60% increase in incoming migrants registered in Italy compared to January 2014. There were close to 3,500 recorded deaths last year, making it the deadliest sea crossing in the world.

		EU ‘burying heads in the sand’ as hundreds more migrants die at sea off Italy
	","
		The European Union and its member states must hang their heads in shame following reports this morning that as many as 300 migrants are believed to have died in the high seas off the Italian island of Lampedusa, said Amnesty International.
“This new tragedy realizes our worst fears about the end of Italy’s Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation and exposes the predictable consequences of the European Union’s failure to provide an adequate replacement,” said John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia Programme Director at Amnesty International.“The humanitarian crisis that sparked the need for Mare Nostrum has not gone away. With people continuing to flee war and persecution, EU member states must stop burying their heads in the sand whilst hundreds keep dying at sea.”According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the number of irregular migrants arriving by sea in January 2015 increased by around 60% over the same month last year, when Mare Nostrum was in place. This makes a mockery of suggestions that the search and rescue operation – whose demise was widely publicized – was encouraging migrants to take this dangerous route.The EU’s operation Triton, dubbed as a replacement for Mare Nostrum, is not focused on search and rescue, does not routinely operate in international waters, and is significantly reduced in scale. “It’s a simple equation – as the number of people taking this perilous sea route goes up and the resources put into search and rescue go down, more people will die,” said John Dalhuisen.On Monday 9 February, 29 migrants died, most of them of hypothermia, after Italian coast guards rescued them from an inflatable dinghy carrying 106 people, including children. Reports suggest that the rescue operation was extremely difficult due to severe weather conditions. According to Italian media reports, nine survivors from two other boats informed the Italian coast guards that more than 200 migrants were on two other dinghies, while a third one, according to still unconfirmed reports, is said to have disappeared with no survivors, carrying a further estimated 100 people to their death. The dinghies were believed to be drifting in extreme sea conditions with waves as high as 8 metres and temperatures just a few degrees above zero, according to coast guards’ statements. Those who died were believed to be between 18 and 25 years old and from sub-Saharan Africa.“It’s possible the Italian coast guards did what they could with the resources they had. They clearly were not enough. Unless EU member states commit to significantly increasing search and rescue capacity in the central Mediterranean, tragedies like these will only multiply,” said John Dalhuisen.
